[13:30] <sayan> *- *Chapter 3: Understanding VCS: Branches*
[13:30] <sayan> *- Few months more have passed. Tux visits a local workshop & presents one of his image.
[13:30] <soumam007> :)
[13:30] <sayan> *- Two clients love his image but one wants to add a Sepia tone to it and another want Black & White (B&W)
[13:30] <sayan> *- Tux now needs to change the work flow again, because over time Tux would be getting more and more clients.
[13:30] <sayan> *- Tux like Newton sat under a tree waiting for a apple to fall, but instead notices the branches of the trees which gave Tux an idea. A revolutionary one!
[13:31] <NikitaK3> Roll Call: Nikita Kotak
[13:31] <sayan> *- So Tux comes back home and starts working on the image. But now Tux creates two copies of images & names the directory as sepia & bw.
[13:31] <sayan> *- Tux who just happened to know linking, linked working directory to the sepia directory
[13:31] <sayan> *- So in the morning, Tux opens the working directory (which is pointing to sepia directory) opens the sepia directory
[13:32] <sayan> *- In the evening, Tux changes the link to bw, so Tux can work on bw image over the rest of the time.
[13:33] <sayan> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/vvEi9Satwai2FOprwAh0YQ
[13:33] <sayan> *- Next time, Tux get a new client, Tux just needs to create new branch directory & start working.

[13:40] <sayan> next
[13:40] <ashwanig> sayan, Why so?
[13:40] <ahole> How to revert back to a snapshot? I was wondering about that for the entire day .
[13:40] <bhavin192> ahole, search
[13:40] <im_mohsin> sayan, As saikat_ said when he was in root directory he did git init right. So does it make his entire root a git directory?
[13:41] <Padfoot7> !
[13:41] <sayan> ashwanig: I forgot the exact reason, vivek_ do you remember? I remember discussing it with you
[13:41] <sayan> ahole: git revert
[13:42] <avik> \me requests someone to pm what has been going on today, please!
[13:42] <sayan> im_mohsin: yes

[13:43] <sayan> soumam007: yes, delete the .git directory
[13:43] <sayan> next
[13:43] <saikat_> sayan, im_mohsin , wait what, if i did a git init and made my root a git directory, how do i revert it?
[13:43] <soumam007> ok
[13:43] <sayan> I told the answer just now
[13:44] <sayan> Moving ahead
[13:44] <balaji> If I shut down the system without commiting the changes Is the staging area will remain same when I restart?
[13:44] <saikat_> got it, yes. sayan
[13:44] <sayan> balaji: yes, it will be there because those are saved in a file
[13:44] <vivek_> balaji: the concept of "save" still remains same
[13:45] <balaji> Okay. got it. Thanks
[13:45] <sayan> and all the stuffs you do in git are saved
[13:45] <sayan> - git checkout -b sepia # Create a new branch -b=tells to create new branch
[13:45] <sayan> - vim hellomars.txt # Add the text "Snapshot 4"
[13:45] <darkJedi> !
[13:45] <sayan> - git add -u
[13:45] <sayan> - git commit -m "Snapshot 4"
[13:46] <sayan> - git branch # Tell which branch you are in?
[13:46] <sayan> next
[13:47] <saikat_> *sepia
[13:47] <sayan> Right
[13:47] <ghishadow> git branches are just reference or lightweight movable pointer to a commit , so if there are no commit in repositary then are no branches
[13:48] <ahole> *sepia
[13:48] <ghishadow> there*
[13:48] <darkJedi> Suppose I make a wrongful change in my source code and I have to revert back to the previous commit. How should I do it?
[13:48] <asraisingh> avik, I had sent you today's log from the class start.
[13:48] <darkJedi> eof
[13:49] <hemanth> !
[13:49] <sayan> darkJedi: there are a bunch of ways to do it, git-revert, git-reset. but that's something I won't discuss in this class
[13:49] <sayan> next
[13:49] <cran-cg> !
[13:50] <hemanth> is branching created for versions
[13:50] <sayan> next
[13:50] <ahole> !
[13:50] <sayan> hemanth: versions as in?
[13:50] <ashwanig> ghishadow, Thanks :)
[13:50] <hemanth> sayan, like version 1.1 and version 1.2 of same software
[13:51] <sayan> hemanth: no
[13:51] <cran-cg> after git add -u , i did git status, I get nothing added to commit
[13:51] <sayan> cran-cg: fpaste the output
[13:52] <sayan> hemanth: versions are very much on code level and not git but there are commands to manage the version well
[13:52] <messifc> sayan: sorry I have to leave urgently.
[13:52] <sayan> branches are to carry out parrallel development on the same working directory
[13:52] <asraisingh> !
[13:53] <hemanth> thanks sayan
[13:53] <anuGupta> Cran_cg : after git add -u ,you have to git commit -m "snapshot4"
[13:53] <cran-cg> sayan: https://pastebin.com/n8CvmWEG
[13:53] <sayan> like in Fedora, we maintain two branch master & develop. The development happens on develop and when we have to release we merge develop into master
[13:54] <sayan> and master is latest version and is deployed
[13:54] <bhavin192> cran-cg, you have not added the hellomars.txt to tracked files, we have done it in last session
[13:54] <sayan> cran-cg: you did not properly follow in last class
[13:54] <sayan> cran-cg: what do you thing you should do??
[13:55] <cran-cg> sayan: I made a new txt file.
[13:55] <cran-cg> Silly mistake
[13:55] <cran-cg> Understood
[13:55] <ashwanig> sayan, merging develop into master means replacing the old files in master with their new versions in develop right?
[13:55] <soumam007> cran-cg, share your mistake
[13:55] <ashwanig> Sorry I asked out of turn
[13:56] <deepika> !
[13:56] <sayan> ashwanig: the proper word would be updating
[13:56] <sayan> next
[13:56] <sayan> next
[13:56] <sayan> next
[13:56] <ahole> Now currently we are on the sepia branch, how do we jump back to the master branch?
[13:56] <deepika> if Tux wanted to create subbranch and navigste how would he do that ?
[13:57] <sayan> deepika: there is nothing as sub-branch
[13:57] <deepika> s / navigate
[13:57] <sayan> and I don't understand what do you mean with subbranch
[13:57] <im_mohsin> ahole, git checkout master
[13:57] <sayan> ahole: wait!
[13:57] <SpEcHiDeR> Gaurav: I can see the messages.
[13:57] <deepika> creating new branch like for b&w
[13:58] <cran-cg> soumam007: Umm. I was mistakenly made a new repo :(
[13:58] <cran-cg> Sorry for the confusion
[13:58] <cran-cg> :(
[13:58] <sayan> - git log
[13:58] <deepika> sayan and then change the branch from
[13:58] <avik> what is happening?
[13:58] <deepika> b&w to sepia
[13:58] <championshuttler> what is this going on?
[13:59] <sayan> People calm down
[13:59] <avik> why are people getting disconnected?
[13:59] <sayan> There is nothing to worry,
[13:59] <ashwanig> championshuttler, Matrix server is having problem
[13:59] <sayan> - git log
[13:59] <championshuttler> ashwanig, ok :)
[13:59] <sayan> Check the commits you have
[13:59] <sayan> You will be having the Snapshot 4 commit
[13:59] <sayan> - git checkout master # Simply move around branches
[13:59] <sayan> - vim helloworld.txt # Add the text "Snapshot 5"
[14:00] <sayan> - git add -u
[14:00] <sayan> - git commit -m "Snapshot 5"
[14:00] <sayan> - git log # Notice anything?
[14:01] <ahole> There is no changes in git still says snapshot 3.
[14:01] <im_mohsin> sayan, snapshot 5 after checking out to master?
[14:01] <abhinavshirur> it shows commits from the current branch?
[14:01] <ashwanig> sayan, Yes, Snapshot 5 commit got added
[14:02] <championshuttler> yes a new commit add to the list
[14:02] <jasonbraganza> sayan - not branch commits visible
[14:02] <sayan> You will find that the Snapshot 4 is not there
[14:02] <sayan> That is because Snapshot 4 commit is in sepia branch
[14:02] <bhavin192> sayan, Snapshot 4 is not there
[14:02] <sayan> not in master
[14:03] <sayan> next
[14:03] <sayan> Moving ahead
[14:03] <sayan> - git checkout sepia
[14:03] <sayan> - vim hellomars.txt # Add the text "Snapshot 6"
[14:03] <sayan> - git add -u
[14:03] <sayan> - git commit -m "Snapshot 6"
[14:03] <sayan> - git log # Again, noticed anything?
[14:04] <ganeshnomula_> !
[14:04] <santoshShaw>  new commit, "Snapshot 6"
[14:04] <sayan> next
[14:04] <saikat_> !
[14:04] <sayan> next
[14:04] <jasonbraganza> sayan - Sanpshot 5 missing
[14:05] <sayan> jasonbraganza: yup, Snapshot 5 is missing
[14:05] <saikat_> sayan, i cannot write anything in terminal after the git log. the cursor blinks on a word saying END
[14:05] <ashwanig> Yes
[14:05] <sayan> and Snapshot 6 is on top of Snapshot 4
[14:05] <im_mohsin> saikat_, do :q
[14:05] <sayan> saikat_: press q
[14:06] <sayan> - git checkout -b bw # What we are doing here?
[14:06] <ganeshnomula_> sayan: Is it If we’re in sepia branch and try git log, then it shows all the master and branch commits?
[14:06] <abhinavshirur> creating a new branch bw
[14:06] <saikat_> sayan,im_moshin, thanks, worked, but this did not happen the first time i did dit log
[14:06] <vipulgupta2048_> new branch , sayan
[14:06] <im_mohsin> creating a bw branch
[14:07] <deepika> got the new branch bw :)
[14:07] <im_mohsin> saikat_, happens everytime :)
[14:07] <ikshitij> creating new branch
[14:07] <sayan> ganeshnomula_: yes, because sepia is created of master
[14:07] <asraisingh> creating bw branch
[14:07] <ashwanig> creating a new branch and switching to that branch
[14:07] <sayan> so if you have a-b-c in master
[14:07] <sayan> and then you create a new branch out of master branch
[14:07] <sayan> you will have all the a-b-c commits
[14:07] <sayan>  
[14:08] <sayan> See, I told earlier that it's good that 2-3 people give the reply
[14:08] <sayan> But *nobody* listens
[14:08] <sayan> Moving ahead
[14:08] <sayan> - vim hellomars.txt # Add the text "Snapshot 7"
[14:08] <sayan> - git add -u
[14:08] <sayan> - git commit -m "Snapshot 7"
[14:09] <sayan> - git log # What do you notice?
[14:09] <ganeshnomula_> !
[14:09] <sayan> next
[14:10] <ganeshnomula_> sayan: should I’ve to type in git checkout -b bw?
[14:10] <soumam007> getting a bit confused

[14:10] <im_mohsin> ganeshnomula_, yes
[14:10] <jasonbraganza> no snapshots from sepia in here
[14:11] <cran-cg> sayan: History of last 4 commits including the ones done on sepia branch
[14:11] <yurii> switchwd to new branch

[14:32] <casper01> Got my query answered. Thanks <eom>
[14:32] <sayan> next
[14:32] <imranjeetsingh_> why i am seeing commits of sepia in bw ?
[14:32] <balaji> whenever we create a new branch is that is created from the master branch or the current branch we are in?
[14:32] <jasonbraganza> balaji - branch you’re in
[14:33] <sayan> imranjeetsingh_: because when you created a new branch bw, you were in sepia
[14:33] <sayan> imranjeetsingh_: so you checked out a new branch bw out of sepia
[14:33] <im_mohsin> imranjeetsingh, because you were in sepia when you created bw and all commits in sepia were copied in bw :)
[14:33] <balaji> jasonbraganza, Thanks
[14:33] <imranjeetsingh_> ok thanks
[14:33] <sayan> imranjeetsingh_: so when you checkout a new branch you will have all the commits from the branch you are checking out
[14:33] <sayan> next
[14:34] <saikat_> my output is not matching with ahole. Will you see once at https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/hiF89k41HhnPhYVxDYiV3w ? i am getting snapshots 7,6,3,2 repeated 3 times.  ahole got snapshots 7,6,5,3,2,1 repeated twice. where is it going wrong? here is ahole's: https://pastebin.com/zmpkuuZV.
[14:34] <sayan> next
[14:34] <ganeshnomula_> My question is answered thanks :)
[14:34] <Padfoot7> can we import changes to "one particular file"  from another branch ?
[14:35] <im_mohsin> Padfoot7, yes you can do something like merge but thats a topic for other day i guess
[14:35] <sayan> Padfoot7: the question sounds ambiguous
[14:35] <sayan> saikat_: ahole did messup
[14:35] <sayan> :)
[14:36] <anuGupta> !
[14:36] <ganeshnomula_> imranjeetsingh_: check this tree link posted by sayan and perform git -log from different branches, you’ll understand what you’re getting. https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/sjKIB8WYg78Mhpe2jbb5EQ
[14:36] <sayan> The commit tree should be like this
[14:36] <im_mohsin> hahaha.. yeah.. saikat_ check sayan commits
[14:36] <sayan> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/sjKIB8WYg78Mhpe2jbb5EQ
[14:36] <saikat_> sayan, ohh, is mine correct? i am getting the idea of branches, but still struggling with the implementation.
[14:36] <imranjeetsingh_> thanls ganeshnomula_
[14:37] <sayan> Just travese from the end I have written branch name in brackets and move back
[14:37] <sayan> tonext
[14:37] <sayan> next
[14:37] <sayan> next
[14:37] <anuGupta> I can see only last 4 commits when I do git log under any of the branches.Why is it?<EOF>
[14:38] <sayan> anuGupta: is those last four commits Snapshot 99, Snapshot 98, Snapshot 97 and Snapshot 96
[14:38] <sayan> ?
[14:38] <anuGupta> No
[14:39] <hemanth> i think git diff sepia and bw will help
[14:39] <sayan> anuGupta: you need to explain more.
[14:39] <anuGupta> Under log of bw I am getting snapshot 7 6 4 3 only
[14:39] <saikat_> !
[14:39] <sayan> anuGupta: so when you do git log you see the commits that your screen can adjust
[14:39] <sayan> anuGupta: and just press enter, and the log will scroll
[14:40] <sayan> next
[14:40] <bhavin192> anuGupta, down arrow
[14:40] <saikat_> sayan, very silly question, but i am not getting how to read and match your tree with the graph in my terminal. Help please
[14:40] <anuGupta> Oops sorry
[14:40] <sayan> saikat_: which graph?
[14:40] <saikat_> git log --graph --all
[14:41] <sayan> saikat_: ignore
[14:41] <saikat_> or just git log
[14:41] <sayan> saikat_: you don't have to
[14:41] <sayan> the one that in the link is the one I made manually
[14:41] <joyhimanshu_> !
[14:41] <sayan> next
[14:41] <sayan> Moving ahead
[14:41] <joyhimanshu_> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/f4hc5ECL4rh8n-Ez8FBJ-A can u explain littlebit : sayan
[14:41] <sayan> *- *Chapter 4: Understanding VCS: Remotes*
[14:42] <sayan> *- It's been an year now, Tux owns a shop now.
[14:42] <sayan> *- So, Tux uses cloud services to backup the photos & publish photos.
[14:42] <sayan> *- Tux has setup some network endpoints, so that when Tux drops the photos into a particular endpoints it backup the photos in the particular cloud.
[14:42] <sayan> *- Tux's friend Nux is a computer programmer so who did the setup
[14:42] <sayan> *- The endpoints are origin: which points to Flickr
[14:42] <sayan> *- flickr: again points to Flickr
[14:42] <sayan> *- dropbox: points to Dropbox
[14:43] <sayan> *- 500px: points to 500px
[14:43] <sayan> *- When Tux runs: tux-shop push 500px sepia, it pushes the sepia photo directory to 500px
[14:43] <sayan> *- tux-shop push dropbox bw, it pushes the drop directory to dropbox
[14:43] <sayan> *- Tell me what would tux-shop push origin bw do?
[14:43] <im_mohsin> drop bw to irigin
[14:43] <im_mohsin> origin
[14:43] <jasonbraganza> push the master to flickr?
[14:44] <bhavin192> Push bw to Flickr
[14:44] <championshuttler> push to flickr
[14:44] <jasonbraganza> crap! sorry. not myself tonight
[14:44] <imranjeetsingh__> push to master
[14:44] <cran-cg> Flickr
[14:45] <santoshShaw> push to original repository
[14:45] <vishami3> push bw to origin
[14:45] <sayan> So origin is Flickr, and the branch is bw
[14:45] <skarpy> !
[14:45] <sayan> so it pushes the branch bw to Flickr
[14:45] <jasonbraganza> push bw to flickr
[14:46] <sayan> so basically remotes as the remote endpoint you want to interact with
[14:46] <sayan> next
[14:46] <skarpy> how origin is flickr? it can be dropbox.
[14:46] <sayan> skarpy: "*- The endpoints are origin: which points to Flickr "
[14:47] <skarpy> sayan: ok so it might point to somewhere else, you didnt define that before, ok got it :) <eom>
[14:47] <bhavin192> skarpy, he had defined it
[14:47] <sayan> skarpy: I had defined it
[14:47] <skarpy> so, if thre
[14:48] <skarpy> if there is push origin sepia, it goes to 500px?
[14:48] <saikat_> !
[14:48] <cran-cg> skarpy: [20:14] <@sayan> *- The endpoints are origin: which points to Flickr
[14:48] <im_mohsin> !
[14:48] <sayan> skarpy: no, it pushes sepia to 500px
[14:48] <sayan> let me discuss it more clearly
[14:48] <sayan> and then you can ask questions
[14:48] <skarpy> sayan: ok
[14:48] <bhavin192> skarpy, *- When Tux runs: tux-shop push 500px sepia, it pushes the sepia photo directory to 500px
[14:48] <realslimshanky>  /msg NickServ identify QWERTY.123
[14:48] <sayan> So, every remote has a name and a value
[14:49] <sayan> realslimshanky: we just say **********
[14:49] <bhavin192> realslimshanky, nice password xD
[14:49] <realslimshanky> Sorry! Now I'll have to change my password
[14:49] <skarpy> lol
[14:49] <skarpy> bhavin192, gotit, thank you! :)
[14:49] <championshuttler> lol
[14:49] <sayan> So, every remote has a name and a value
[14:49] <skarpy> s/gotit/ got it
[14:49] <sayan> value is the endpoint
[14:49] <sayan> and the name is with what you are referring to
[14:50] <sayan> so suppose in my laptop I do the setup
[14:50] <sayan> origin: pushes to Flickr
[14:50] <asraisingh_> its necessary to always push through end point?
[14:51] <sayan> flickr-remote: pushes to Flickr <here the name is flickr remote & endpoint is a Flickr URL (you will understand more during examples)>
[14:51] <rkased> Razy Kased
[14:51] <sayan> rkased: are you joining now?
[14:51] <rkased> No
[14:51] <rkased> Sorry
[14:51] <sayan> 500px-remote: pushes to 500px
[14:52] <sayan> rkased: then? Why do you write your name in between sessions everyday
[14:52] <rkased> Today was a mistake
[14:52] <rkased> I'm trying to follow your explanation of remote and endpoint
[14:52] <sayan> so in that case I need to do "tux-push flickr-remote bw" to push bw to Flickr
[14:53] <sayan> see you mention the name and then git would fetch the value and iteract with the URL
[14:53] <sayan> rkased: no issues :)
[14:53] <rkased> Excellent
[14:53] <sayan> Hope that makes things clear, a bit atleast
[14:53] <sayan> next
[14:54] <saikat_> is setting up origin important? can we not do   "tux-shop push flickr"?
[14:54] <jasonbraganza> saikat_ from which branch?
[14:54] <bhavin192> saikat_, then you will have to specify the URL every time
[14:55] <sayan> saikat_: you can just do tux-shop push, then it picks up origin & current branch
[14:55] <sayan> by default
[14:55] <saikat_> ohh, okay.
[14:55] <sayan> saikat_: or if you mention the remote name then the branch name is the current branch
[14:55] <sayan> I follow naming them all
[14:56] <bhavin192> sayan, he is asking that setting up is important or not
[14:56] <sayan> better to be explicit
[14:56] <saikat_> wait, i did not get your last line, please rephrase it?
[14:56] <sayan> saikat_: origin is there by default in git
[14:56] <sayan> saikat_: but you can remove it
[14:56] <jasonbraganza> saikat_ - allways spell things out clearly. then there is less scope for confusion
[14:57] <saikat_> jasonbraganza, what did i spell wrong?
[14:57] <sayan> at the end of the you need it just resolves names to values and then does the operation
[14:57] <jasonbraganza> saikat_ - i meant  specify things clearly
[14:57] <sayan> saikat_: :) don't worry. All is Well
[14:58] <saikat_> jasonbraganza, okay, yes.
[14:58] <sayan> saikat_: I meant you should write all the stuffs like branch name, remote name etc
[14:58] <sayan> next
[14:58] <im_mohsin> got answered when you explained now
[14:58] <bhavin192> !
[14:58] <sayan> next
[14:58] <bhavin192> If the origin is already there, then where will it point?
[14:59] <sayan> bhavin192: will tell after class
[14:59] <sayan> I don't want bombarded with questions :)

[15:14] <sayan> oops sorry
[15:14] <sayan> wrong url
[15:14] <sayan> https://github.com/<username>/git-class-dgplug2017.git

[15:24] <im_mohsin> yes
[15:25] <sayan> im_mohsin: git push --all will push all branches
[15:25] <bhavin192> balaji, you have to set the mail id with `git config`

[15:28] <skarpy> sayan: ok, i made a different repo, which will be useful to me later! :p
[15:28] <sayan> hacker_: the last commit you did in master in hellomars.txt was that of Snapshot 3
[15:29] <sayan> skarpy: sure, you are going to suffer later, can't help
[15:29] <sayan> skarpy: but it would be useful to you, so never mind
[15:29] <bhavin192> sayan, some people are too smart :)

[15:29] <skarpy> bhavin192: :(
[15:29] <balaji> I  am not able to see the branches in github. Is I have to push that to. If yes How to do that?
[15:30] <sayan> balaji: you haven't pushed them
[15:30] <balaji> s/to/too
[15:30] <bhavin192> skarpy, I'm not saying anything to you, seriously :(
[15:30] <sayan> balaji: check the logs, I told to im_mohsin
[15:30] <skarpy> bhavin192: ok :p
[15:31] <im_mohsin> balaji, here git push --all, it pushes all the branches

[15:34] <yurii> how can I recieve a password if it looks like do not remember
[15:34] <sayan> It's like same number stored in your phone with two different names
[15:35] <championshuttler> yurii: you can reset it after going to github.com
[15:35] <sayan> yurii: https://github.com/password_reset
[15:35] <yurii> thank you
[15:35] <sayan> - git remote -v
[15:35] <sayan> should show both the remotes now
[15:36] <ashwanig> yes
[15:36] <hacker_> yes
[15:36] <sayan> adas0496: yes? a class is going on
[15:37] <adas0496> sayan, sorry that was by mistake
[15:37] <sayan> - git checkout sepia
[15:37] <sayan> - git push another-remote sepia
[15:38] <imranjeetsingh__> done
[15:38] <hacker_> done
[15:38] <sayan> So now you push via "another-remote"
[15:38] <sayan> In Github you would see two branches
[15:38] <sayan> sepia & master
[15:38] <hacker_> yes
[15:39] <sayan> Ending the class here
[15:39] <sayan> Any questions?
[15:39] <bhavin192> !
[15:39] <skarpy> !
[15:39] <asraisingh_> i hv some questions but will ask u later
[15:39] <ahole> How do you combine the master and other branches ?
[15:40] <sayan> next
[15:40] <bhavin192> Is it necessary to git checkout branch-name before pushing it?
[15:40] <balaji> !
[15:40] <sayan> bhavin192: no
[15:40] <sayan> next
[15:40] <ahole> sorry I spoke out of turn.
[15:40] <sayan> next
[15:40] <skarpy> so, if i have x number of remote, are those opening me to branches?
[15:41] <asraisingh_> sorry sayan.
[15:41] <sayan> what do mean by opening me to branches
[15:41] <sayan> asraisingh_: next is ban :)
[15:41] <asraisingh_> ok.
[15:41] <ahole> !
[15:41] <sayan> next
[15:41] <skarpy> i mean like, master is the main or source, and then we have branches, we can add branches to our repo, by adding remotes?
[15:42] <balaji> What will happen if we pushed those changes in same origin remote ?
[15:42] <ahole> How do you combine all the branches to form a new master branch ?
[15:42] <sayan> balaji: nothing the output will be same
[15:42] <sayan> as the remote si pointing to same URL
[15:42] <balaji> So  why we are adding another remote?
[15:42] <bhavin192> ahole, may be next class
[15:42] <sayan> skarpy: remote is way of communicating with the remote repo
[15:43] <sayan> ahole: git merge
[15:43] <sayan> Okay I see where people got consfused
[15:43] <sayan> I wanted to demo the name another-remote
[15:43] <sayan> we could have also done git push origin sepia
[15:44] <sayan> at the end of the day, git sees that it needed to push sepia to origin remote
[15:44] <sayan> skarpy: balaji got it?
[15:44] <sayan> next
[15:44] <skarpy> ok. so push origin sepia will do the same
[15:44] <avik_> !
[15:44] <sayan> next
[15:44] <skarpy> ok, got it
[15:45] <balaji> sayan, Got it
[15:45] <avik_> can we push to other clouds? like flickr or dropbox as yu said?
[15:45] <_anshul> yes
[15:45] <avik_> s/yu/you
[15:45] <skarpy> sayan: it will show under branch of github, i suppose<eom>
[15:46] <balaji> sayan, As like in example origin and Flickr pointing to same thing correct?
[15:46] <sayan> avik_: that was a fictional story
[15:46] <sayan> avik_: to explain
[15:46] <sayan> balaji: right
[15:46] <avik_> okay, so its only for VCSs?
[15:46] <anuGupta> !
[15:46] <sayan> there are some protocols if the serves on the receiving end is following that
[15:46] <hemanth> !
[15:46] <sayan> then you can push
[15:46] <sayan> next
[15:47] <sayan> next
[15:47] <hemanth> getting stuck at another-remote
[15:47] <anuGupta> Where in the github do I see the branches?
[15:47] <avik_> sayan: thanks. got it! <eom>
[15:47] <hemanth> can get a short explanation of what is it <eof>
[15:47] <sayan> anuGupta: Ctrl + F and then type Branch
[15:48] <_anshul> <anuGupta> https://github.com/<username>/<repo_name>/branches
[15:48] <sayan> hemanth: what did you not understand
[15:48] <sayan> ?
[15:48] <sayan> another-remote is just another remote name
