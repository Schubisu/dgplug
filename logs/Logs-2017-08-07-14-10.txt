[14:10] <fhackdroid> #startclass
[14:11] <skat-sd> !
[14:11] <fhackdroid> next
[14:11] <skat-sd> how do we control the 1st number?
[14:11] <fhackdroid> skat-sd, good question
[14:11] <fhackdroid> so range actually take three parameters
[14:12] <fhackdroid> first parameter is the number form which you want to initiate the range
[14:12] <fhackdroid> second number is the number till which that range should count excluding the number
[14:13] <fhackdroid> and third is the step
[14:13] <kushal> sayan, rtnpro fhackdroid we had documentation https://ircbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
[14:13] <kushal> add: fhackdroid
[14:13] <kushal> masters
[14:13] <kushal> .masters
[14:13] <tenida> kushal: Error: "masters" is not a valid command.
[14:13] <skat-sd> ohh, like this: for i in range(1,10): print(i).  Got it
[14:13] <fhackdroid> skat-sd,  yes
[14:13] <skat-sd> thanks, fhackdroid
[14:14] <fhackdroid> skarpy, not only that but you can try something like range(1, 10, 2)
[14:14] <jasonbraganza> fhackdroid - in 2s?
[14:14] <fhackdroid> jasonbraganza, yes
[14:14] <jasonbraganza> got it
[14:14] <fhackdroid> try it :)
[14:14] <skarpy> Fhackdroid: ok
[14:15] <fhackdroid> hope you guys are clear with range ?
[14:15] <fhackdroid> yes ?
[14:15] <RIcharD_> Yes.
[14:15] <skarpy> yes
[14:15] <samridhia> yes
[14:15] <neer> Yes
[14:15] <atul916> yes
[14:15] <skat-sd> yes
[14:15] <fhackdroid> cool so lets do a simple problem ?

[14:16] <championshuttler> yes
[14:16] <asraisingh> yes
[14:17] <san-D> done
[14:17] <fhackdroid> The problem is called "Scooby Doo" Print numbers from 1 to 100 and for every number which is multiple of 3 print Scooby , for number multiple of 7 print Doo and for 3 and 7 print Scooby Doo
[14:18] <fhackdroid> is the question clear ? ^
[14:18] <asraisingh> yes
[14:19] <fhackdroid> paste your solution on fpaste and post a link here :)
[14:19] <bhavin192> If the number is 3 then it should print Scooby instead of 3, right?
[14:20] <fhackdroid> if the number is multiple of 3
[14:20] <fhackdroid> it should print scooby instead of 3
[14:20] <bhavin192> fhackdroid, we were using azure notebooks for Python sessions, should we use that?
[14:20] <kushal> bhavin192, YES
[14:20] <fhackdroid> bhavin192, anything works :)

[14:25] <fhackdroid> RIcharD_, i don't think so you got it right :)
[14:25] <knrai> https://notebooks.azure.com/n/Eg3NDOBW9To/notebooks/summertraining.ipynb
[14:25] <RIcharD_> fhackdroid, but it worked :(
[14:26] <atul916> https://repl.it/KADY/0
[14:26] <fhackdroid> so can someone review RIcharD_ code : https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/XV0sizsb9Y8tGR717Xy-uA

[14:26] <fhackdroid> RIcharD_, try for number 21 ;)
[14:26] <RIcharD_> fhackdroid, it just prints scooby :(
[14:27] <devesh_verma> RIcharD_,  you will never get Scooby Doo
[14:27] <bhavin192> This one is correct https://notebooks.azure.com/bhavin192/libraries/dgplug/html/summertraining.ipynb
[14:27] <bhavin192> s/correct/correct link

[14:36] <anuGupta> Pooja_ check your indentation. The following print statement should be after a few spaces or a tab
[14:36] <atul916> how about my code?
[14:36] <balaji> fhackdroid, devesh_verma  kindly check now
[14:36] <fhackdroid> neer, no need of continue there
[14:36] <abhinavshirur> akshayg96, not the expected output

[14:37] <fhackdroid> atul916, link ?
[14:37] <bhavin192> knrai, fhackdroid> if the number is multiple of 3 <fhackdroid> it should print scooby instead of 3

[14:39] <devesh_verma> balaji, can you share your URL once again
[14:39] <skarpy> fhackdroid : its printing scooby and doo all the way :(
[14:39] <pr97> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/JyUCzTVEE5hJTphdwyXqHQ
[14:39] <fhackdroid> atul916, nope not right , check for 21
[14:39] <san-D> abhinavshirur:  corrected
[14:39] <abhinavshirur> san-D, I liked the condition if first if :D
[14:39] <fhackdroid> skarpy, think about what are you missing!
[14:39] <abhinavshirur> * in first if
[14:39] <asraisingh> fhackdroid: review https://notebooks.azure.com/n/Sj7eturEzLc/notebooks/summertraining.ipynb
[14:40] <fhackdroid> okay everyone listen up
[14:40] <sitlanigaurav[m]> fhackdroid: I haven't missed but printed s and d and both again
[14:40] <RIcharD_> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/8bPkOFgFHHrhAdCLPQ3r-A
[14:40] <fhackdroid> I want your attention here
[14:40] <skarpy> fhackdroid: https://notebooks.azure.com/n/A0TVv10zWEg/notebooks/summertraining.ipynb
[14:40] <fhackdroid> say yes if you guys are paying attention
[14:40] <ashwanig> yes
[14:40] <schubisu> es
[14:40] <abhinavshirur> yes
[14:40] <schubisu> *yes

[14:41] <jasonbraganza> yes
[14:41] <neer> yes
[14:41] <anuGupta> Yes
[14:41] <fhackdroid> okay what I am going to say is not related to python but programming
[14:41] <fhackdroid> you guys are doing a hit and try
[14:42] <fhackdroid> if this works or it doesn't
[14:42] <fhackdroid> that is not how you should think
[14:42] <fhackdroid> even before you start writing code
[14:42] <fhackdroid> the solution should be clear in your mind
[14:42] <fhackdroid> think before you write
[14:43] <fhackdroid> give a read to the problem
[14:43] <fhackdroid> there is very important skill which is analyzing
[14:43] <pr97> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/4DJ1LzYIGbkZ6OyQYTPw6A
[14:43] <fhackdroid> think about the problem, see what are the condition
[14:43] <fhackdroid> think about the edge cases
[14:43] <ikshitij> https://notebooks.azure.com/kshitiz/libraries/dgplug/html/Scooby-Doo.ipynb
[14:44] <fhackdroid> where it can break
[14:44] <fhackdroid> learning a technology is like knowing the tool but even before using the tool you should know what you are using the tool for.
[14:45] <fhackdroid> Else it will be like a spanner in monkey's hand the only thing it can cause is a lot of things to break, Given that monkey is not experimental.
[14:45] <pr97> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/JyUCzTVEE5hJTphdwyXqHQ
[14:46] <fhackdroid> are you guys getting what I am trying to say ?
[14:46] <jasonbraganza> yes fhackdroid
[14:46] <anuGupta> Yes
[14:46] <pr97> yes
[14:46] <championshuttler> yes

[14:46] <atul916> sorry got disconnected can anyone give logs of last 8 min
[14:46] <san-D> yes
[14:47] <fhackdroid> so lets think logical here
[14:47] <fhackdroid> how many of you got the solution ?
[14:47] <jasonbraganza> me
[14:47] <neer> yes
[14:47] <championshuttler> atul916: check pm
[14:47] <championshuttler> me

[14:48] <RIcharD_> Me
[14:48] <asraisingh> me
[14:48] <knrai> yes

[14:48] <jasonbraganza> i did
[14:48] <anuGupta> Me
[14:48] <asraisingh> i
[14:48] <RIcharD_> I did.

[14:48] <neer> me
[14:48] <sitlanigaurav[m]> Me
[14:48] <neer> and i did
[14:48] <devesh_verma> I used and
[14:49] <fhackdroid> lets make it a little more fun
[14:49] <fhackdroid> do the same but this time you are not allowed to use the and operator
[14:49] <fhackdroid> is the question clear ?
[14:49] <jasonbraganza> san-D already had the solution
[14:49] <balaji> I used
[14:49] <jasonbraganza> i’d just be copying :)
[14:50] <RIcharD_> Yes
[14:50] <knrai> https://notebooks.azure.com/n/Eg3NDOBW9To/notebooks/summertraining.ipynb
[14:50] <fhackdroid> jasonbraganza, you shouldn't have told that :P
[14:50] <abhinavshirur> bhavin192 did that iirc :P
[14:50] <bhavin192> abhinavshirur, :-/
[14:51] <fhackdroid> okay good work people.
[14:51] <fhackdroid> so if you see the solution without and
[14:52] <neer> http://sprunge.us/EfjA
[14:52] <abhinavshirur> sorry :-/
[14:52] <fhackdroid> if you see this problem it is a very basic problem
[14:52] <fhackdroid> but not a lot of you got it in the first go
[14:53] <ikshitij> fhackdroid: We can use nested if else
[14:53] <fhackdroid> that happened because you were not thinking clearly
[14:53] <fhackdroid> this problem actually have a name
[14:53] <soumam007> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/YI5TngslL089PC1ZEE2MpQ
[14:53] <fhackdroid> does any of you know that ?
[14:54] <jasonbraganza> nope
[14:54] <anuGupta> !
[14:54] <skarpy> what is that name?
[14:54] <jasonbraganza> and please don’t say PEBKAC
[14:55] <championshuttler> jasonbraganza: what is PEBKAC?
[14:56] <skarpy> championshuttler: google.
[14:56] <championshuttler> got it :) problem exists between keyboard and chair
[14:56] <fhackdroid> nobody knows what this problem is called ?
[14:56] <fhackdroid> cool let me give you something to search for
[14:56] <fhackdroid> this problem is called the fizz buzz problem
[14:57] <fhackdroid> this problem is called the fizz buzz problem
[14:57] <ikshitij> Oooh ! I solved the same on Hackerearth
[14:58] <soumam007> yeah fhackdroid got it
[14:58] <soumam007> :) dont know why they give such a typical name
[14:58] <ikshitij> Fizz Buzz Test
[14:59] <soumam007> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9461446/c-programming-the-fizzbuzz-program
[14:59] <jasonbraganza> fhackdroid - is that what we just did?
[14:59] <anuGupta> It's working for & too instead of and. Is this correct or not?
[15:00] <ashwanig> anuGupta, & is bitwise and not logical and
[15:00] <anuGupta> Yup but it gave the correct answer so asked
[15:00] <fhackdroid> ikshitij, yes
[15:00] <fhackdroid> any questions till now ?
[15:00] <fhackdroid> jasonbraganza, yes that is what you did :)
[15:00] <jasonbraganza> i always thought FizzBuzz was something complicated :P
[15:01] <jasonbraganza> !
[15:01] <fhackdroid> jasonbraganza, well you uncomplicated the complicated
[15:01] <fhackdroid> next
[15:01] <jasonbraganza> unrelated to the clas question
[15:01] <fhackdroid> next
[15:01] <jasonbraganza> how legal is it to use the youtube-dl module to download music lists? asking because samridhia is using the module as an example and I’m worried for her. should she change her blog post?
[15:01] <pie3> which distributed services you know about/use/heard ? e.g. SVN is distributed
[15:01] <anuGupta> It's working for & too instead of and. Is this correct or not?
[15:02] <anuGupta> Why is it giving correct output<EOF>
[15:02] <fhackdroid> pie3, class is going on
[15:02] <ashwanig> anuGupta, You should figure it out why it is working. What is the result of 1&0?
[15:02] <bhavin192> jasonbraganza, AFAIK it is not legal
[15:02] <pie3> how to jump into class
[15:03] <samridhia> jasonbraganza, are there any legal issues with modules too?
[15:03] <anuGupta> Oh yes thanks ashwanig
[15:03] <bhavin192> jasonbraganza, she should read more about copyright
[15:03] <championshuttler> samridhia: legal issues are with dowloading content without permission i think
[15:03] <fhackdroid> anuGupta, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22646463/difference-between-and-boolean-vs-bitwise-in-python-why-difference-i
[15:03] <bhavin192> jasonbraganza, samridhia, let's discuss it after class
[15:04] <jasonbraganza> samridhia, not the module, but *what* you download I think
[15:04] <anuGupta> Ok fhackdroid
[15:04] <samridhia> bhavin192, ok i will now read everything about copyright.
[15:04] <fhackdroid> hope that answers your question
[15:05] <ikshitij> jasonbraganza: downloading content from YouTube is illegal, doesn't matter you use x module or y module or you are FBI officer :)
[15:05] <fhackdroid> okay guys so do you guys know about the data structure called list in python ?

[15:16] <fhackdroid> jasonbraganza, why the brackets around fruits ?
[15:16] <asraisingh> done
[15:17] <ashwanig> jasonbraganza, variable name
[15:17] <ikshitij> for i in range(len(fruits)):
[15:17] <jasonbraganza> fhackdroid - mistake! sorry
[15:17] <fhackdroid> atul9162, can you iterate over the list using a for loop and print it
[15:17] <ikshitij> print (fruits[i])
[15:17] <atul9162> yes

[15:17] <soumam007> done fhackdroid
[15:17] <soumam007> :)
[15:18] <knrai> for i in fruits:
[15:18] <knrai> print(i)
[15:18] <fhackdroid> championshuttler, try the same with for loop
[15:19] <atul9162> https://repl.it/KADY/1
[15:19] <jasonbraganza> ashwanig - for fruit_salad_ingredient in fruits: print (fruit_salad_ingredient)
[15:19] <ikshitij> https://notebooks.azure.com/kshitiz/libraries/dgplug/html/summertraining.ipynb last line
[15:19] <championshuttler> fhackdroid: ok :)
[15:19] <fhackdroid> ikshitij, good try :)
[15:20] <fhackdroid> so you guys should look into https://notebooks.azure.com/kshitiz/libraries/dgplug/html/summertraining.ipynb
[15:20] <fhackdroid> and https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/NThyk5k2
[15:21] <fhackdroid> these are two ways to iterate through the list
[15:21] <skat-sd> https://notebooks.azure.com/skat-sd/libraries/dgplug/html/summertraining.ipynb
[15:21] <jasonbraganza> understood
[15:21] <fhackdroid> the second link is more readable than the first one
[15:22] <atul9162> is anything wrong wih my method?
[15:22] <fhackdroid> atul9162, nope its perfect
[15:22] <anuGupta> How to print on the same line?
[15:23] <atul9162> ok, thanks
[15:24] <fhackdroid> https://repl.it/KADY/2
[15:24] <fhackdroid> have a look at this ^
[15:24] <skat-sd> !
[15:25] <fhackdroid> readability counts
[15:25] <fhackdroid> next
[15:25] <soumam007> same
[15:25] <skat-sd> how do we print them in the same line?
[15:25] <ashwanig> anuGupta, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+print+in+the+same+line+in+python
[15:26] <championshuttler> ashwanig: :D
[15:26] <fhackdroid> print(i, end='')
[15:26] <fhackdroid> skat-sd, ^
[15:26] <jasonbraganza> anuGupta ^
[15:26] <skat-sd> yes, thanks
[15:26] <ikshitij> anuGupta: use 'end = ''"'
[15:26] <fhackdroid> okay your code is an art
[15:26] <fhackdroid> take it that way
[15:27] <fhackdroid> try to use meaningful variable names
[15:27] <fhackdroid> the more the readability the better it is
[15:27] <ikshitij> https://notebooks.azure.com/kshitiz/libraries/dgplug/html/summertraining.ipynb anuGupta
[15:28] <fhackdroid> okay so ready for one more question
[15:28] <jasonbraganza> shoot
[15:29] <ikshitij> jasonbraganza: Ready with weapon and Armor ? :P
[15:30] <championshuttler> ikshitij: he is ready with machine gun :P
[15:30] <fhackdroid> Given a list basket = ["apple", "banana", "pineapple", "mango"] pick out the fruits whoes name starts with a vowel
[15:31] <fhackdroid> any questions till now ?
[15:31] <ikshitij> Print those or store in another list ?
[15:31] <fhackdroid> print the once starting with a vowel
[15:32] <fhackdroid> now remember the quality of code matters with this one
[15:32] <fhackdroid> so think twice before naming your variables
[15:32] <fhackdroid> any more questions regarding the session ?
[15:33] <jasonbraganza> fhackdroid - please do more?
