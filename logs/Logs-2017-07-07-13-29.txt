[13:44] <soumam007_> sudo apt-get install docutils?kushal
[13:45] <im_mohsin> !
[13:45] <rahuldecoded_> soumam007, I guess sphinx has dependency on docutils. So first install sphinx
[13:45] <yurii> i have this result https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/8rsWjZvua8j0rcqBwVY3Kw
[13:46] <Cyber_freak> I should install using pip or pip3  ? What we will be using in the session ?

[13:48] <joyhimanshu> rahuldecoded : I install using pip
[13:48] <bhavin192> Cyber_freak, who told you to use pip?
[13:49] <kushal> yurii, the package must be python-sphinx
[13:49] <kushal> next
[13:49] <im_mohsin> I installed python-docutils using apt get and the output is this: https://pastebin.com/33ugSDeA Does it means its installed correctly?
[13:50] <ashwanig> im_mohsin, Seems like you already had python-docutils
[13:50] <bhavin192> im_mohsin, you already have the package
[13:50] <cran-cg_> im_mohsin: Yes
[13:50] <im_mohsin> bhavin192, ashwanig, cran-cg_ ubuntu has it by default?
[13:51] <ashwanig> im_mohsin, I am on ubuntu but I had to install it
[13:51] <im_mohsin> ashwanig, bhavin192 cran-cg_ Thank you :)
[13:51] <ikshitij> im_mohsin: you already had package ! Package manager ran update only
[13:51] <cran-cg_> Cyber_freak: [19:15] <@kushal> soumam007_, Install the packages from your system package. [19:15] <@kushal> dnf or apt-get

[13:53] <soumam007_>  how can i check if it has downloaded properly?
[13:53] <kushal> soumam007_, apt-get command should tell you that.
[13:53] <kushal> soumam007, You never used apt-get before?
[13:53] <Phi_mb> !
[13:53] <yurii> is it ok this  result ----https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/KUy3YiAPU6Rb5TTKnjQYJg

[13:54] <soumam007_> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/X2C4NdEZwgkoRSEWITSl7w
[13:54] <ashwanig> soumam007_, what is %tages?
[13:55] <soumam007_> ashwanig, i meant percentages sorry for inconvenience
[13:55] <sandeepK> soumam007: try apt-cache policy python-docutils
[13:56] <NikitaK3> !
[13:56] <kushal> yurii, Did it actually installed?
[13:56] <soumam007_> sandeepK, its done :) thanks
[13:56] <kushal> next
[13:56] <Phi_mb> What would be the difference if we install via pip or system package? <eom>
[13:56] <kushal> next
[13:56] <sandeepK> soumam007: welcome
[13:57] <NikitaK3> While installing python 2 packages while using python 3 is it necessary to always have python-<package_name> in command line?
[13:57] <ikshitij> soumam007_: By the way copy 'error or error code' and Google ! It will help you and you will get the reason also.
[13:57] <kushal> Phi_mb, system package means it will be installed system-wide, and that is supposed to be well tested along with the other packages in the distribution. We never told anything about pip to people here, so some people are just trying to act smart.
[13:58] <kushal> NikitaK3, you have to give the right package name.
[13:58] <ahole[m]> kushal: Agreed! it was really quick in fedora. And I even got time to update my pip and install pandas for my Data mining class tomorrow,.
[13:58] <kushal> NikitaK3, Which distribution are you using?
[13:58] <cran-cg> yurii: https://askubuntu.com/questions/829370/n-ignoring-file-50unattended-upgrades-ucf-dist-in-directory-etc-apt-apt-con
[13:58] <skat_sd> yurii, https://askubuntu.com/questions/882251/apt-get-update-errors-50unattended-upgrades-ucf-dist
[13:58] <soumam007_> ikshitij, thanks i will :)
[13:58] <cran-cg> skat_sd: ;)
[13:58] <Phi_mb> kushal: Ok, got it.
[13:59] <kushal> Anyone still waiting for the install?
[13:59] <NikitaK3> kushal, Ubuntu 16.04
[13:59] <lucifer_> yes
[13:59] <mdbk> yes
[14:00] <skat_sd> cran-cg, :)
[14:00] <anuGupta> !
[14:01] <kushal> next
[14:01] <anuGupta> Is there any difference between sudo dnf install and sudo dnf -y install ? I searched but could not find it.<EOF>
[14:01] <kushal> NikitaK3, search by using "apt-cache search docutils"
[14:01] <kushal> and see what are the actual package names.
[14:01] <bhavin192> anuGupta, try it once
[14:01] <ghishadow`> anuGupta, you don't need to confirm with Yes with -y
[14:02] <kushal> anuGupta, Yes, if you provide -y, then you don't have to type yes :)
[14:02] <skat_sd> anuGupta, -y basically means you are already saying yes to download
[14:03] <anuGupta> Yes I did sudo dnf install but it gave failed to synchronize repo updates whereas sudo dnf -y install perfectly installedl
[14:03] <adas0496> on Ubuntu this should work: "sudo apt-get install python-docutils python-sphinx"
[14:04] <anuGupta> Thanks everyone :)
[14:04] <NikitaK3> kushal, okay thank you
[14:05] <bhavin192> anuGupta, Sometimes it may fail
[14:05] <skat_sd> anuGupta, also see this: https://ask.fedoraproject.org/en/question/88086/error-failed-to-synchronize-cache-for-repo-fedora/
[14:06] <anuGupta> Oh
[14:07] <mdbk> !
[14:07] <kushal> next
[14:08] <mdbk> I tried installing python-docutils on ubuntu 16.04 and got this error https://pastebin.com/7MTduTS2
[14:10] <ashwanig> mdbk, You are installing something else in another terminal?
[14:10] <vishami3> mdbk you have processes running which are already installing some software..just finish it and retry installing
[14:10] <mdbk> Okay
[14:11] <kushal> next
[14:12] <bhavin192> mdbk, reboot your machine
[14:12] <kushal> Now, every start following https://dgplug.org/irclogs/2012/rst-primer/  if you are done, type done here, if you have any queries feel to raise your hand.
[14:13] <mdbk> bhavin192: Alright

[14:20] <ashwanig> <eof>
[14:20] <kushal> yes
[14:20] <kushal> those are different ways to write comments
[14:20] <kushal> which will not be rendered into HTML
[14:21] <gauravsitlani> !
[14:21] <kushal> next
[14:21] <jiteshpabla> !
[14:21] <kushal> next
[14:21] <gauravsitlani> I did not understand doctest blocks.
[14:22] <gauravsitlani> please can you elaborate?<eom>
[14:22] <jiteshpabla> Why is rst important? when we already have markdown?
[14:22] <kushal> gauravsitlani, skip that, we are yet to do Python.
[14:22] <kushal> jiteshpabla, because it has way more things to do proper technical documentations.
[14:23] <im_mohsin> !
[14:23] <kushal> jiteshpabla, and we will learn more about why in the coming weeks.
[14:23] <kushal> next
[14:23] <im_mohsin> kushal, section title are centered. can we change it?
[14:23] <kushal> im_mohsin, Yes, you will have to pass CSS to the command
[14:24] <kushal> im_mohsin, search about it, I never did it
[14:24] <im_mohsin> oh okay. so after we convert that to html and we can design more with css. Thanks
[14:24] <kushal> jiteshpabla, At least one thing we will learn at the end today.
[14:27] <soumam007_> looks like the man pages :)
[14:28] <kushal> next

[14:30] <ahole[m]> !
[14:32] <ahole[m]> There is a small error in the document: it says "1. item 1 text" but if you write like "1. item 1 pizza" the output comes like "1. item 1 pizza" instead it should be "1. text" and so the output will be "1. pizza"...
[14:32] <ahole[m]> <eom>
[14:32] <kushal> next
[14:33] <ashwanig> Some section titles are smaller than sub section title. Why?<eof>
[14:33] <kushal> ashwanig, paste the .rst file please
[14:34] <kushal> ahole[m], "1. item 1 pizza" should show 1. item 1 pizza
[14:34] <im_mohsin> !
[14:35] <kushal> next
[14:35] <lucifer> where we will be using it?
[14:35] <kushal> lucifer, what rst? In documentation, and also in code in Python.
[14:35] <sandeepK> !
[14:35] <kushal> next
[14:35] <im_mohsin> kushal, for ordered list shows a error for me "Bullet list ends without a blank line"
[14:35] <kushal> lucifer, and some other fancy place
[14:35] <im_mohsin> sorry
[14:35] <ashwanig> kushal, I made a mistake. Sorry for that.
[14:36] <kushal> im_mohsin, Correct, if you read it again, it is telling you to give a blank line :)
[14:36] <kushal> next
[14:36] <kushal> next
[14:36] <sandeepK> kushal, got this error https://pastebin.com/brYsv0yU

[14:40] <kushal> remove those
[14:40] <kushal> next
[14:40] <ashwanig> Cannot understand lists and literal blocks slides<eof>
[14:41] <kushal> ashwanig, literal blocks just shows you whatever you wrote.
[14:41] <kushal> ashwanig, lists are lists of items.
[14:41] <kushal> next
[14:41] <samridhia> I can not understand what is the use of footnotes?
[14:42] <mrlmachine> !
[14:43] <kushal> samridhia, Have you seen footnotes in books or research papers?
[14:44] <sandeepK> kushal, now got this "test.rst:9: (ERROR/3) Unexpected indentation."
[14:44] <samridhia> no! actually i don't know what footnotes are?
[14:44] <samridhia> I will google it
[14:44] <kushal> sandeepK, means you have wrong indentation on that line
[14:45] <kushal> samridhia, https://eng244.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/footnote1.jpg
[14:45] <kushal> next

[14:46] <samridhia> kushal, got it.
[14:46] <kushal> mrlmachine, you don't, just an example.
[14:46] <kushal> next
[14:47] <soumam007> mrlmachine, i guess like in you write only ¨git¨ there in the terminal you get a lot of option ; similar type
