[15:12:14] <sayan> next
[15:12:18] <prashaant> sayan: How the previous assignment is going to be of any help to a python novice , it was about someone (I respect that person) doing great stuff in python, but again how does that helps someone who hasn't wrote a single line in python , like many in this class ? I just want to say that  assignment could've been after teaching some python
[15:12:19] <vbhjain> !

[15:14:54] <indiabhi> how difficult is it to contribute to cpython for an intermediate python developer?
[15:14:54] <Anandprakash> Thanks LambaInsaan
[15:14:56] <abhishekg5> prashaant, slowly you'll get the knack of it. It's 3rd day of training
[15:15:16] <shalaka> !
[15:15:30] <ananthakrishnan> could you please tell about yesterdays assignment once more?
[15:15:55] <gkadam> ananthakrishnan, https://dgplug.org/irclogs/2013/2013-07-17-ncoghlan.log

[15:16:32] <anushil051> sry
[15:16:46] <rahul_bajaj> ananthakrishnan, it would be great if you used - ! to ask a question.
[15:17:02] <LambaInsaan> anushil051, It's sorry.
[15:17:02] <prashaant> sayan: okay I just thought of it keeping beginners in mind.I thought someone could get intimated by reading that (If h/she hasn't written some code), but thank you for your response
[15:17:13] <pabitrakumarpati> ananthakrishnan, there are so many replies to your query... Instead of asking again and again, you need to scroll up and see...
[15:17:14] <vbhjain> !
[15:17:28] <mhalano> !
[15:17:33] <indiabhi> ncoghlan meantions about two of his talks, Do we have to watch both of them as well? I watched one which was related to contributing to CPython but not the other one
[15:17:39] <indiabhi> how difficult is it to contribute to cpython for an intermediate python developer?
[15:18:14] <rahul_bajaj> indiabhi, please use ! to ask questions.
[15:18:26] <shashank> !
[15:18:33] <indiabhi> yeah i did, it was my turn apparantely :/
[15:18:37] <trishnag> rahul_bajaj: He did :)
[15:18:46] <sayan> rahul_bajaj: indiabhi's turn :)
[15:19:01] <rahul_bajaj> indiabhi, i am sorry dint see that :)
[15:19:33] <sayan> indiabhi: good you watched the talks :) Not neccessary now but you can have a look at non-technicals talks
[15:19:53] <sayan> indiabhi: not that difficult to contribute to CPython, just like any other project
[15:19:55] <sayan> next
[15:20:00] <indiabhi> okay :)
[15:20:02] <anushil051> what is GET call ?
[15:20:34] <sayan> anushil051: GET call is something related to APIs which would be advanced for the beginners here
[15:21:00] <sayan> so let's skip it. Btw, you can google it
[15:21:01] <sayan> next
[15:21:10] <vbhjain> sayan , I'm providing the part of conversation in which I have the problem :
[15:21:11] <vbhjain> <sayan> ncoghlan, you told about pythonmentors.com, are there mentored bugs in Python? how do we identify them?<ncoghlan> sayan: we try to mark bugs that we think are good starting points with "easy" in the tracker
[15:21:11] <vbhjain> .<ncoghlan> but the standard library is so bug, it's hard to use that flag appropriately
[15:21:11] <vbhjain> ?   which flag <ncoghlan> is taking about?
[15:21:12] <CuriousLearner> anushil051, still if you want to learn about it, you can refer here: http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html and ask after class if you've any doubt
[15:22:00] <pabitrakumarpati> !
[15:22:08] <sayan> CuriousLearner: +!
[15:22:10] sk_ is now known as ksaikiranr
[15:22:49] <sayan> vbhjain: issues in open source projects are tagged/flagged so that people who can pick up issues
[15:22:58] <sayan> a new comer will pick up easy issues
[15:23:13] <CuriousLearner> vbhjain, each bug is tagged with a flag so that it's easy to know which part is affected and how difficult it is to fix the bug. Most of the bug trackers have 'beginner' tags or similar
[15:23:14] <sayan> next
[15:23:17] <hemanth_savasere> Can anyone tell me what is the mailing atticates followed in open source and is it different from those used in professional industry ?
[15:23:17] <chirath> !
[15:23:25] <vbhjain> sayan,ok
[15:23:38] <gkadam> anushil05, also you can read http://www.rfc-base.org/txt/rfc-2616.txt
[15:23:46] <snarwade> hemanth_savasere, etiquettes*
[15:23:53] <hemanth_savasere> sorry
[15:23:56] <sayan> hemanth_savasere: depends, some company set their own ettiquetes.
[15:24:09] <chshbh> hemanth_savasere : one of them is, grammar need not be correct, but check for spellings.
[15:24:28] <sayan> but the open source one are kind of the good ones so you can follow them too in professional life
[15:24:29] <vbhjain> !
[15:24:34] <sayan> I myself follow that
[15:24:37] <sayan> next
[15:24:40] <shalaka> what will be todays session about on python or question answer seesion only ?
[15:25:09] <kushal> Btw, we do have http://rfc.dgplug.org
[15:25:09] <vbhjain> sayan, upto how much degree python scripting is important for system 1.administrators ? and for 2.system developers ?
[15:25:21] <sayan> shalaka: yes, today we will be start with basic linux commands
[15:25:32] <shalaka> thanks
[15:25:50] <abstatic> +1 vbhjain
[15:26:30] <sayan> vbhjain: sky is the limit, the more you know the better
[15:26:38] <rahuldecoded_> kushal what's that in your link?
[15:26:49] <kushal> rahuldecoded_, google for rfc
[15:26:51] <vbhjain> sayan,ok
[15:27:05] <CuriousLearner> sayan, +1
[15:27:06] <sayan> It also depends on which project you are interested not all administrators and sys devs learn same level of Python
[15:27:32] <sayan> some may work in other, so they might go deeper in that language
[15:27:33] <sayan> next
[15:27:57] <sayan> next
[15:27:59] <mhalano> Same question as before, mas with references. I found this line on yesterday assignment: âI like to be a project member in your team. please send me the detailsâ. How this could be an unpolite? Maybe say the same as a question, like "I like to be a project member in your team. Could you send me the details?"?
[15:28:11] <mhalano> s/mas/but
[15:28:46] <hemanth_savasere>  mhalano +1
[15:28:46] <kushal> mhalano, People first need to spend time with a project.
[15:28:47] ananthakrishnan is now known as anonymous619916
[15:29:06] <vbhjain> !
[15:29:22] <kushal> Any amount of help is nice, but first one should spend time with the project to call himself/herself a member.
[15:29:22] <anushil051> !
[15:29:31] <sayan> next
[15:29:35] <sayan> next
[15:29:40] <pabitrakumarpati> pythonmentors.com/core-mentorship@python.org
[15:29:45] <tabrez> kushal +1
[15:29:59] <pabitrakumarpati> these links are project for python i guess
[15:30:09] <pabitrakumarpati> but how could they help beginner
[15:30:29] <mayurparik> server not found!
[15:30:30] <buvanesh_kumar> Buvanesh Kumar
[15:30:50] <pabitrakumarpati> are any survey kinda thing lies here
[15:31:21] <kushal> pabitrakumarpati, No. You will learn more in the later part of the training.
[15:31:37] <anonymous619916> meanwhile malayalis https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/W3gHuENS/1118.jpg
[15:31:48] <kashyap638> !
[15:32:00] <pabitrakumarpati> @kushal, so can i say i need nt to worry on this for now ??
[15:32:01] <arthar360> pabitrakumarpati, kinda = kind of?
[15:32:11] <sayan> pabitrakumarpati: Python has this program as core-mentorship. As a complete befineer it's not useful but check that after we have the Python sessions
[15:32:23] <kushal> pabitrakumarpati, Yes, no need to worry.
[15:32:24] <sayan> then it will make sense
[15:32:29] <sayan> next
[15:32:30] <pabitrakumarpati> arthar360, yes... sorry for using short hand... :(
[15:32:32] <chirath> Already answered :)
[15:32:39] <sayan> chirath: cool :)
[15:32:41] <avik> !
[15:32:42] <sayan> next
[15:32:47] <vbhjain> sayan,Why <ncoghlan> said that python is easy to learn and difficult to master ? if it is the case then how much a novice should work ,to be tuned with the training going on?
[15:33:08] <Anandprakash> !
[15:33:09] <pabitrakumarpati> oh ok... thanks kushal sayan
[15:33:20] <PrashantJ> vbhjain, +1
[15:33:32] <sayan> vbhjain: it's takes an afternoon to learn Python if you have prior knowledge in a programming language
[15:34:02] <shanky_> vbhjain, +1
[15:34:06] <sayan> But this is true for any language that it takes 10 years to learn a skill
[15:34:20] <sayan> vbhjain: we will learn it later today

[15:35:55] <rahuldecoded_> kashyap638 https://dgplug.org/irclogs/2016/
[15:36:10] <sayan> pksadiq: should not be discussed while class is going on

[15:37:02] <sayan> kushal: avik: I guess that was a mistake
[15:37:19] <avik> okay leave it
[15:37:52] <vbhjain> !
[15:37:54] <sayan> Anandprakash: usually you get to know that from the documentation or the setup.py
[15:38:00] <sayan> going in detail is out of scope
[15:38:05] <Richard99> !
[15:38:09] <sayan> next
[15:38:10] <Anandprakash> okay,thanks
[15:38:14] <vbhjain> sayan, what is the purpose of python -m antigravity told by <ncoghlan>
[15:38:21] <pabitrakumarpati> Anandprakash, I guess if you are making a pri=oject then __init__.py will be your entry point
[15:38:23] <Sparker0i> !
[15:38:24] <rahuldecoded_> Anandprakash i think you should study the codes first. You will get to know about it. No one can guess with the file name
[15:38:31] anonymous619916 is now known as ananthakrishnan
[15:38:33] <prashaant> vbhjain: just for fun

[15:39:08] <sayan> oops vbhjain ^^
[15:39:13] <Anandprakash> yes,Thanks
[15:39:19] <vharsh> just like chrome's dragon game instead of showing you a boring message, "sorry you are not connected"
[15:39:20] <sayan> reserve this question when we teach python modules

[15:43:18] <sayan> This article tell that how you learning a Programming language takes 10 years
[15:43:24] <sayan> and it's an incremental process
[15:43:27] <pabitrakumarpati> sayan, is it tomorrow's assignment ??
[15:43:52] <sayan> pabitrakumarpati: yes
[15:43:56] <gkadam> !
[15:44:21] <sandeepmaity09> !
[15:44:27] <sayan> If you want to be a programmer  then the best way to sit on a laptop and code
[15:44:29] <shanky_> !
[15:44:41] <aman935> +m
[15:44:47] <hemanth_savasere> !
[15:44:48] <sayan> you learn it by doing. The more you do the better you get
[15:44:50] <sayan> next
[15:44:54] <sayan> next
[15:44:57] <gkadam> sayan, http://norvig.com/21-days.html is giving 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable

[15:45:41] <sayan> next
[15:45:41] <sandeepmaity09> What to do with the link given by Kushal ?
[15:45:50] <shanky_> what is an easter egg
[15:45:54] <prabhatsharma> !
[15:46:14] <sandy_> shanky_: google it
[15:46:30] <sayan> better let me take the class and then once I tell to ask questions ask
[15:46:46] <arthar360> sayan :'D
[15:46:48] <sandeepmaity09> ohk, sayan
[15:46:51] <pabitrakumarpati> +1 sa
[15:46:53] <Richard99> okay
[15:46:57] <pabitrakumarpati> +1 sayan
[15:47:03] <Sparker0i> okay sir
[15:47:09] <abstatic> +1 sayan
[15:47:11] <ShaswataD> !
[15:47:55] <sayan> so the last point that I discussed was that you learn things by doing
[15:48:06] <sayan> The more you code the better you get at it
[15:48:37] <sayan> You need to spend at least 10years/10000hours to be good at it
[15:49:06] <sayan> Spend time reading code. By reading code of good developers you learn the best practices
[15:49:50] <sayan> Talk/Discuss to other developers over IRC/Mailing Lists etc
[15:50:21] <sayan> Open source is a lot about collaboration.
[15:50:57] <sayan> So, collaborate with other developers. This will help you working in a team
[15:51:33] <sayan> Like ncoghlan told about PEP. Read about the standard practices
[15:52:00] <sayan> Languages/Projects have their own set of guidelines. Learn to follow them
[15:52:44] <sayan> and try to learn more programming languages
[15:53:01] <sayan> Make a habit to read techinal books
[15:53:15] <sayan> Set deadlines to finish off a book
[15:53:36] <sayan> Maybe a week, fortnight, monthly
[15:53:53] <sayan> Apply those concepts while you program
[15:54:27] <sayan> You can know more by reading the assignment - http://norvig.com/21-days.html

[15:54:51] <sayan> next
[15:54:53] <pabitrakumarpati> sayan, reading just goes in waste if you don't practice them and apply
[15:54:53] <anushil051> technical book any you can suggest for now
[15:54:55] <ShaswataD> Similar to Fedora as a FOSS development OS, what type(make, platform) of hardware would best serve FOSS development without causing much trouble with compatibility and driver issues?
[15:54:56] <Sparker0i> !
[15:55:16] <sayan> pabitrakumarpati: yeah right
[15:55:19] <prashaant> anushil051, +1

[15:55:38] <prabhatsharma_> !
[15:55:41] <thisisashwani> i am currently reading the book "the little schemer"
[15:55:48] <pabitrakumarpati> sayan, so there is no point in completeing the book withing given deadline... that's what I think
[15:55:54] <snarwade> ShaswataD, thinkpad series
[15:56:04] <thisisashwani> anushil051: you can try that
[15:56:16] <sayan> anushil051: patience, not now
[15:56:44] <Sparker0i> ShaswataD, Fedora + Lenovo (Definitely not ASUS)
[15:56:47] <sayan> just grasp the basic concepts, then we will give :)

[15:56:52] <sayan> next
[15:57:04] <sayan> next
[15:57:05] <avik> will a beginer like me understand a language just by reading technical books?
[15:57:17] <chshbh> sayan, for a beginner, concentrating on one language should be preferred over learning couple of language as per the blog?
[15:57:21] <Richard99> Sparker0i +1
[15:57:22] <abhishekcs10> !
[15:57:25] <sayan> avik: no, practice by doing is the key
[15:57:32] * ShaswataD says thanks to Sparker0i and snarwade
[15:57:49] <sayan> by reading you pick up the best practices but you need to apply
[15:57:50] <acetakwas> avik::  Yes, by also following the examples in "the book."
[15:57:59] <sayan> chshbh: one for now
[15:57:59] <pabitrakumarpati> sayan, yes that's what I was trying to point what avik asked..
[15:58:10] <tabrez> !
[15:58:11] <kushal> avik, and before programming, there are many things to be learn.
[15:58:14] <kushal> next
[15:58:24] <sayan> chshbh: programming constructs you need to learn
[15:58:27] <sayan> next
[15:58:37] <abstatic> i had the same question as anushil051 , regarding technical books , which ones to read ?
[15:58:43] <abk1> !

[15:59:40] <sayan> next
[15:59:43] <sayan> next
[15:59:44] <Sparker0i> Is it really good to learn programming languages that have applications which are poles apart? (For example, C# to develop Windows Apps , Java for Android apps and ObjectiveC for macOS)?
[15:59:45] <shobhitupadhyay> which technical book we read?and how create interest to read it habitually?
[15:59:45] <prashaant> ritesh, technical books == related to computer programming , programming languages , algorithms , data structure etc.
[16:00:03] <prabhatsharma_> What does +1 means?
[16:00:10] <avik>  thanks. kushal would you like to elabote a little bit? if you dont mind!
[16:00:12] <prashaant> shobhitupadhyay, will be told later in the training
[16:00:23] <rahuldecoded_> ritesh in short magazine for geeks
[16:00:23] <JoelIsSPL> !
[16:00:25] <ritesh> OK. Thanks prashaant sayan

[16:01:19] <avik> thank you so much
[16:01:21] <kushal> indiabhi, It is still an open discussion.
[16:01:22] <kushal> next
[16:01:25] <abhishekcs10> sayan, please elaborate what set of programming languages do make a person full stack developer...?
[16:01:38] <kushal> abhishekcs10, you should discuss these after sessions.
[16:01:48] <kushal> abhishekcs10, and also please ask that to google.com
[16:01:49] <kushal> next
[16:01:52] <tabrez> sayan, what is mode +m and -m means?
[16:01:54] <sayan> abhishekcs10: out of scope let's discuss after session
[16:01:58] <Anandprakash> As I have good knowledge of basic python, I have been reading effective python, according to you, is it good book to read ?
[16:02:05] <rahuldecoded_> indiabhi enjoy the session mate.
[16:02:08] <sayan> tabrez: IRC admin commands
[16:02:09] <kushal> tabrez, with +m rest of the people here can not speak/type.
[16:02:15] <abhishekcs10> ok
[16:02:17] <kushal> -m means back to normal.
[16:02:18] <kushal> next
[16:02:21] <abk1> does mathematics skill boost up coding skills??
[16:02:31] <kushal> abk1, not always.
[16:02:42] <tabrez> thanks kushal sayan
[16:02:56] <abk1> ok thanks :)
[16:03:04] <kushal> abk1, Most great programmers I know in Python world are from different backgrounds than science/engineering
[16:03:06] <kushal> next
[16:03:12] <buvanesh_kumar> So there is no way to expert in one language within 2 or 3 months ? I want to expert in Python language as much as possible
[16:03:23] <JoelIsSPL> Does the C++ I've learnt in the 12th class
[16:03:36] <prashaant> buvanesh_kumar, read the link given by sayan
[16:03:40] <kushal> sayan, Have you shared the norvig article link?
[16:03:44] <kushal> Yes you did.
[16:03:49] <buvanesh_kumar> yes it shows 10 years :(
[16:03:58] <kushal> buvanesh_kumar, That is what it takes.
[16:04:02] <tabrez> sayan,the link is not opening

[16:05:03] <tabrez> abstatic, thanks ,now opening
[16:05:10] <acetakwas> You people don't have to say "+1" every time.
[16:05:12] <vbhjain> kushal, following the technical book is really very fascinating thing but all the times examples given in those books don't work well because of some sort of system dependency or any thing else ,so how to spend time in these circumstances you think?sayan, following the technical book is really very fascinating thing but all the times examples given in those books don't work well because of some sort of system dependency or any thing else ,so how to spend
[16:05:13] <vbhjain>  time in these circumstances you think?
[16:05:20] <kushal> hemanth_savasere, depends on person to person. I prefer to do actual upstream programming.
[16:05:43] <kushal> vbhjain, start with simple books
[16:06:02] <kushal> vbhjain, It happens to us also.
[16:06:19] <vbhjain> kushal,ok
[16:06:21] <prashaant> vbhjain, generally every error you are going to face by reading a technical book , you will find answers on google + stackoverflow
[16:06:39] <kushal> next
[16:06:43] <kushal> next
[16:06:44] <ananthakrishnan> can you suggest a good language for a beginner like me?

[16:09:12] <kushal> next
[16:09:19] <kushal> JoelIsSPL, may be.
[16:09:31] <pabitrakumarpati> and what you refer by "simple books"
[16:09:36] <abhishekg5_> JoelIsSPL, yes. You can relate one language with other
[16:09:37] <kushal> I never learned any computer programming during school days.
[16:09:45] <kushal> pabitrakumarpati, The ones whose examples work.
[16:09:46] <kushal> next
[16:09:49] <Anandprakash> What are the best practices to write the REST in python?
[16:09:55] <prashant0493_> Why did you say 'learn as many languages as you can'? Briefly. Mastering on few won't help?
[16:09:55] <prashant0493_> Sorry missed turn due to connection problem
[16:10:02] <kushal> Anandprakash, wrong question for this class.

[16:11:01] <kushal> pragnavi, ask please.
[16:11:11] <buvanesh_kumar> Is learning programming requires mathematics knowledge? we need to expert in maths in order to succeed in programming career?
[16:11:32] <pragnavi> due to connection problem i missed some par of this session can i get it?
[16:11:50] <kushal> pragnavi, after the class
[16:11:54] <rahul_bajaj> pragnavi, you can reffer the logs after the session.
[16:11:56] <kushal> buvanesh_kumar, mostly no.

[16:19:19] <kushal> To use your computer efficiently, you will find that terminal is the best way.
[16:19:22] <prashaant> kushal , just a suggestion mute everyone else , while you teach
[16:19:31] <abstatic> yes
[16:19:34] <kushal> We can do many things faster there than clicking on any window.
