[16:08:58] <iKshitij>  Kshitij
[16:09:00] <praveenkumar> How many of you already know about ansible (it is fine if you know little bit)?
[16:09:36] <SRvSaha> I am totally new. Heard the term second time today
[16:09:37] <sayan> Sayan Chowdhury
[16:09:55] <code_geek> I am also totally new to it
[16:09:55] <praveenkumar> So looks like most of folks are newbie here.
[16:10:07] <moizsajid> Never heard of it
[16:10:13] <indiabhi> No i don't know , totally new
[16:10:13] <hydro> I am totally new.no idea
[16:10:19] <sayan> I know tids and bits :)
[16:10:20] <mbtamuli12_> Little bit.
[16:10:35] <mahesh5> no idea
[16:10:37] <abstatic> I am new as well
[16:10:51] <praveenkumar> So we will do a very basic session today and then some more stuff in another session.
[16:11:01] <yASH_> Demo video helped a little
[16:11:02] <sandeepk> No idea, but heard the name before
[16:11:05] <iKshitij> Totally new ! Heard never tried to do research ! Never googled
[16:11:13] <shashank_loki>  I am also new to it.
[16:11:24] <radhikaa> Ansible is used to automate IT deployments
[16:11:44] <praveenkumar> Did everyone have it install in system?
[16:11:58] <abstatic> yes
[16:12:00] <radhikaa> yes
[16:12:00] <imack> yes
[16:12:11] <PrashantJ> yes
[16:12:11] <mbtamuli12_> Yes.
[16:12:12] <SRvSaha> praveenkumar: I installed it using the ppa using apt-get in ubuntu. Is it fine ?
[16:12:14] <shashank_loki> yes
[16:12:15] <LambaInsaan> Yes.
[16:12:16] <Anupama> yep
[16:12:21] <gobinda> yes, but how to test it work or not

[16:13:22] <SRvSaha> Ok thanks praveenkumar
[16:13:51] <praveenkumar> folks who didn't install it can you do it fast. meanwhile I will ask some questions which will setup our expection about this tool.
[16:15:38] <praveenkumar> So if you folks check what ansible is then you will find => Ansible is a radically simple IT automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs.
[16:15:48] <deep123k> I am not able to install ansible tower
[16:15:58] <deep123k> It asked me to fill some form
[16:16:01] <praveenkumar> deep123k: who told you to install tower?
[16:16:14] <deep123k> Link was of ansible tower
[16:16:27] <deep123k> In mailing list
[16:16:58] <abstatic> praveenkumar, is it kind of powerful version of docker ?
[16:17:23] <praveenkumar> deep123k: doesn't http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html# is in the ML?
[16:18:07] <deep123k> Praveenkumar query solved
[16:18:13] <deep123k> Thanks vharsh
[16:18:17] <shobhitupadhyay> shobhit upadhyay
[16:18:20] <praveenkumar> deep123k: which Mailing list you were looking to?
[16:18:33] <deep123k> Dgplug
[16:18:36] <praveenkumar> abstatic: no it's not powerful version of docker
[16:18:39] <deep123k> It had two links
[16:18:47] <deep123k> I opened first one
[16:19:00] <praveenkumar> deep123k: you have to read that mail carefully
[16:19:23] <deep123k> praveenkumar thanks query solved
[16:19:36] <jogender> roll call : JOgender Kota
[16:19:52] <jogender> sorry for late :(
[16:19:53] <praveenkumar> Anyway can anyone of you list down what you folks usually do after installation of a operating system (assume you install fedora today what next)?
[16:20:29] <abstatic> I install all of the software that I require for my development needs like compilers, editors, settings etc
[16:20:38] <mbtamuli12_> I run my bash script to set up chrome, mplayer, zsh, docker, sublime text etc.
[16:20:41] <SRvSaha> 1. Install the most important softwares
[16:20:49] <aniketh_> Roll call: Aniketh Girish
[16:20:50] <SRvSaha> 2. Do some settings.
[16:21:03] <SRvSaha> 3. Get our customization
[16:21:16] <chshbh> update the system
[16:21:19] <moizsajid> I run the update
[16:21:24] <avik> look into you tube for tips and tricks of the os, if its unknown to me
[16:21:27] <aniketh_> paraveen kumar, sorry for being late. I have installed ansible.
[16:21:39] <SRvSaha> mbtamuli12_: How do you maintain your set-up in bash scripts ?
[16:21:40] <hydro> rpm
[16:21:57] <praveenkumar> Alright so let me put a list here.
[16:22:08] <praveenkumar> 1. Update our distro
[16:22:22] <mbtamuli12_> SRvSaha, since session is going on, we can continue in pm.
[16:22:22] <praveenkumar> 2. Setup a repository which might not there default
[16:22:41] <praveenkumar> 3. Install required software
[16:22:58] <praveenkumar> 4. Do some config changes if a software require
[16:23:06] <SRvSaha> mbtamuli12_: Ok, sure. May be after the session
[16:23:19] <c0mrad3> Roll Call: Tummala Dhanvi
[16:23:25] <praveenkumar> 5. Start a service which we want to run (like httpd, mysql ..etc)
[16:24:21] <praveenkumar> Now assume we have to do it for 100 machine is it feasible to do it manually to each machine?
[16:24:37] <sandeepk> no
[16:24:38] <pyadav_> No
[16:24:38] <SRvSaha> No
[16:24:42] <hydro> ohh
[16:24:43] rohan_ is now known as rohan_h
[16:25:03] <cosmologist10> no
[16:25:12] <gobinda> no
[16:25:33] <praveenkumar> So ansible comes in the picture here, it do other lot more stuff but let's we discuss about how it will configure our system.

[16:32:01] <gobinda>   configured module search path = Default w/o overrides is it ok or I have to do any thing
[16:32:19] <praveenkumar> now can you folks add your local system ssh key => execute $ ssh-copy-id <your_username>@127.0.0.1 ?
[16:32:57] <abstatic> yes
[16:34:09] <mbtamuli12_> praveenkumar, is it okay if I am using a VM? I have the ssh-key authentication set up already.
[16:34:15] <vharsh> praveenkumar: Do I need to enable remote login with passwords? I have it disabled.
[16:34:26] <SRvSaha> praveenkumar: I am getting error :/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
[16:34:34] <LambaInsaan> Error /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: ERROR: ssh: connect to host 127.0.0.1 port 22: Connection refused
[16:34:44] <vharsh> So it shows "Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic)."
[16:34:45] <praveenkumar> mbtamuli12_: that will work
[16:35:05] <vharsh> LambaInsaan: Install openssh-server
[16:35:06] <praveenkumar> vharsh: no let it be ssh enabled only
[16:35:24] <LambaInsaan> vharsh, Alright!
[16:35:56] <LambaInsaan> Already installed.
[16:36:03] <praveenkumar> SRvSaha: can you do ssh <user_name>@127.0.0.1 ?
[16:36:06] <vharsh> LambaInsaan: Fedora?
[16:36:14] <vharsh> LambaInsaan: Pm.
[16:36:14] <LambaInsaan> vharsh, Yes.
[16:36:24] <sayan> LambaInsaan: if installed start the ssh server
[16:36:31] <praveenkumar> LambaInsaan: can you able to ssh to your VM with ssh keys only?
[16:36:32] <sayan> s/server/service/
[16:36:56] <abstatic> LambaInsaan: sudo service restart sshd ?
[16:37:25] <SRvSaha> praveenkumar: Nope, I am still getting the connection refused error
[16:37:29] <hydro> 	(to install the contents of '/home/hydro/.pub' anyway, look at the -f option)
[16:37:46] <hydro> 	(to install the contents of '/home/hydro/.pub' anyway, look at the -f option)
[16:37:53] <SRvSaha> praveenkumar: srvsaha@XcidCruX:~$ ssh srvsaha@127.0.0.1 ssh: connect to host 127.0.0.1 port 22: Connection refused
[16:37:55] <LambaInsaan> sayan, How to start SSH server?
[16:38:14] <LambaInsaan> ' systemctl sshd start' ?
[16:38:22] <rohan_h> Same error as hydro
[16:39:23] <LambaInsaan> It's working now! :)
[16:39:24] <sayan> LambaInsaan: yes
[16:39:30] <LambaInsaan> Thanks to vharsh
[16:39:56] <code_geek> praveenkumar, ssh-copy-id wasn't working. ssh <username>@... worked.
[16:40:01] <praveenkumar> Alright let's try to execute $ ansible all -i "localhost," -c local -m ping
[16:40:04] <sayan> SRvSaha: start the ssh service
[16:40:19] <hydro> usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: ERROR: failed to open ID file '/home/hydro/.pub': No such file or directory
[16:40:30] <vharsh> LambaInsaan: swap the sshd with start :p and run it as root :)
[16:40:53] <aniketh_> bash: @127.0.0.1: Permission denied . What should i do ?
[16:40:55] <chshbh> SRvSaha, fixed your error? i am getting the same error :V
[16:41:06] <SRvSaha> sayan: How to start ssh service ?
[16:41:16] <sayan> SRvSaha: which OS?
[16:41:28] <Anupama> got disconnected. what to do after naming the version?
[16:41:38] <sayan> hydro: do you have ssh keys created?
[16:41:39] <vharsh> Anupama: Pm
[16:41:52] <SRvSaha> UBUNTU
[16:41:54] <aman_> Sayan, i am facing the same problem, i have ubuntu 16.04
[16:41:59] <praveenkumar> how many of you executed it without any error $ ansible all -i "localhost," -c local -m ping ?
[16:42:05] <sayan> praveenkumar: /me
[16:42:12] <SRvSaha> chshbh: No I am still getting the error
[16:42:14] <mbtamuli12_> SRvSaha, sudo systemctl start sshd.service || sudo service ssh start
[16:42:15] <code_geek> me
[16:42:31] <hydro> me
[16:42:32] <abstatic> praveenkumar, me :D
[16:42:38] <smdeep_> worked for me
[16:42:49] <gobinda> me
[16:42:54] <pyadav_> executed
[16:42:55] <mbtamuli12_> ping worked.
[16:43:02] <imack> me
[16:43:08] <aniketh_> ping worked.
[16:43:16] <praveenkumar> Folks who are having ssh issue please take help to google (make sure you mention what distro you are using) but right now let's play with ansible.
[16:43:25] <praveenkumar> s/to/from/
[16:43:50] <SRvSaha> praveenkumar: Is this the output we are supposed to get : localhost | SUCCESS => {
[16:43:50] <SRvSaha>     "changed": false,
[16:43:50] <SRvSaha>     "ping": "pong"
[16:43:50] <SRvSaha> }
[16:43:50] <SRvSaha>  ?
[16:44:14] <praveenkumar> SRvSaha: yes and if you have multiple line output always use pastebin
[16:44:28] <sayan> SRvSaha: don't spam the channel, use pastebin
[16:44:30] <Anupama> yes ping worked
[16:44:50] <vharsh> I got the exact same thing SRvSaha, praveenkumar, is it ok?
[16:45:18] <SRvSaha> praveenkumar: Sorry, will take care from next time
[16:45:37] <praveenkumar> So ansible by default use ssh to send any instructions.
[16:46:01] <praveenkumar> In this command you sent a ping to your localhost and then localhost replied back with pong.
[16:46:07] <hydro> rohan_h you found the solution
[16:46:36] <rohan_h> hydro, googling :(
[16:46:38] <praveenkumar> here you can see 'changed' flag also in output. which mean no config change happen when you executed this step.
[16:46:49] <praveenkumar> that's why it says false.
[16:47:09] <deep123k> I am not able to get anything after installing ansible
[16:47:19] <deep123k> Can anyone help
[16:48:03] <avik> deep123k, you are not alone in that track. try Google
[16:48:36] <praveenkumar> Also if you noticed we used -m ping, here m => module. So we tried out it's ping module.
[16:49:13] <praveenkumar> we will discuss about module later but before that try out $ ansible all -i "localhost," -c local -m shell -a 'echo $TERM'
[16:50:16] <gobinda> localhost | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
[16:50:17] <vharsh> praveenkumar: It shows us our $TERM variable content, is it the $TERM of our machine or the $TERM of a virtual machine?
[16:50:18] <gobinda> xterm-256color
[16:50:33] <smdeep_> xterm-256color
[16:51:02] <aniketh_> http://pastebin.com/zHQ8ujrL
[16:51:29] <mbtamuli12_> screen-256color
[16:51:43] <praveenkumar> vharsh: currently we are doing on localhost so your host term not VM
[16:51:50] <Anupama> done
[16:51:54] <vharsh> ok
[16:52:12] <praveenkumar> Anyone face issue with this?
[16:52:30] <code_geek> no
[16:52:32] <PrashantJ> no
[16:52:56] <aniketh_> no
[16:53:02] <imack> no
[16:53:12] <shobhitupadhyay> http://pastebin.com/hbvy9ZyG
[16:53:13] <Anupama> no
[16:53:21] <shobhitupadhyay> no
[16:53:41] <abstatic> nope
[16:53:45] <jargonmonk> no
[16:53:52] <avik> no. but can you please explain what we did? praveenkumar
[16:54:29] <praveenkumar> yes so here we used shell module '-m shell' and then executed 'echo $TERM' on your localhost.
[16:55:04] <radhikaa> what is -c local in command
[16:55:40] <praveenkumar> radhikaa: that's mean we are executing those locally not any remove VM/server.
[16:56:17] <praveenkumar> Now because we all are lazy so we don't want to add -i "localhost" -c local right
[16:56:31] <avik> what is $TERM?
[16:57:29] <praveenkumar> avik: TERM is a environment variable in your local system (check printenv)
[16:57:55] <praveenkumar> Now everyone create a directory name as demo (# mkdir demo)
[16:57:58] <avik> oo ok. thanks
[16:58:22] <praveenkumar> then go inside that directory and then create a file hosts
[16:58:36] <praveenkumar> s/file hosts/file name as hosts/
[16:59:10] <praveenkumar> Content of that file should be  localhost ansible_connection=local
[17:00:08] <praveenkumar> Done?
[17:00:11] <imack> yes
[17:00:12] <sayan> yes
[17:00:13] <code_geek> yes
[17:00:14] <mbtamuli12> Yes
[17:00:21] <PrashantJ> yes
[17:00:21] <sandeepkk> yes
[17:00:28] <cosmologist10_> yes
[17:00:30] <jargonmonk> yes
[17:00:45] <gobinda> done
[17:00:57] <avik> yes
[17:00:58] <Anupama> yup
[17:01:05] <shobhitupadhyay> yes
[17:01:06] <praveenkumar> Alright now again try to execute ansible all -i hosts -m ping
[17:01:12] <aniketh_> yes
[17:01:18] <SRvSaha> yes
[17:01:27] <vharsh> Works the same :)
[17:01:29] <praveenkumar> if you didn't get any error that means you did it right.
[17:01:43] <praveenkumar> yes it should works as before.
[17:02:06] <abstatic> yes it works
[17:02:11] <radhikaa> yes, it worked the same
[17:02:28] <Anupama> yes done.
[17:02:31] <abstatic> but it requires me to be in the same directory
[17:02:34] <shashank_loki> yes done
[17:03:00] <praveenkumar> File we just created is call inventory file in ansible term. Default inventory file present /etc/ansible/hosts and we can use -i flag to use our own inventory file.
[17:03:08] <SRvSaha> praveenkumar: Works only if we are in demo directory
[17:03:23] <abstatic> What is inventory ?
[17:03:41] <praveenkumar> SRvSaha: yes other wise you have to provide abosute path to host file.
[17:04:04] <SRvSaha> praveenkumar: OK thanks
[17:04:08] <code_geek> if we are outside the the directory, then we have to give the the path of the file
[17:04:25] <praveenkumar> abstatic: it just a file which have details about our servers (right now localhost)
[17:04:39] <abstatic> praveenkumar, okay
[17:05:05] <praveenkumar> Everyone open /etc/ansible/hosts file (in fedora this is location I am not sure what is location for other distro)
[17:05:24] <mbtamuli12_> It is the same for Arch Linux.
[17:05:29] <praveenkumar> Try to read it and let me know if something doesn't make sense to you.
[17:06:35] <hydro>  Groups of hosts are delimited by [header] elements
[17:06:36] <hydro> ?
[17:07:16] <LambaInsaan> Can't find it.
[17:07:37] <avik> LambaInsaan, +1
[17:07:55] <hydro> how example  1 and 2 are different ?
[17:08:04] <avik> praveenkumar, not found. [fedora 24]
[17:08:20] <abstatic> can't find it [ubuntu 14.04]
[17:08:32] <praveenkumar> hydro: example one is ungrouped host and 2 is group host.
[17:08:40] <praveenkumar> hydro: I will explain it in a bit.
[17:08:44] <hydro> ok
[17:09:16] <praveenkumar> avik: that's not posible? How did you install it? (using dnf or some other way)?
[17:09:30] <code_geek> !
[17:09:41] <praveenkumar> Can any ubuntu user help abstatic
[17:09:44] <praveenkumar> next
[17:09:45] <abstatic> praveenkumar, i ma using this http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html#running-from-source ?
[17:09:48] <punarvasu510> @abstatic: it works for ubuntu 14.04
[17:09:49] <praveenkumar> next
[17:09:55] <praveenkumar> next
[17:09:57] <praveenkumar> exnt
[17:09:59] <praveenkumar> next
[17:10:00] <avik> just wrote anisble. It prompted me to install or not
[17:10:04] <abstatic> praveenkumar, do i need to install it using apt as well ?
[17:10:07] <avik> praveenkumar, ^^
[17:10:08] <SRvSaha> Works in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
[17:10:31] <abstatic> Got it working
[17:10:44] <radhikaa> @abstatic i could easily find hosts file in /etc/ansible/
[17:10:51] <radhikaa> in ubuntu 14.04
[17:11:15] <abstatic> radhikaa, I was running it directly from source. After installing it using apt I found it as well :D
[17:11:18] <praveenkumar> abstatic: I am not sure but folks who are not able to find then => https://paste.fedoraproject.org/406251/28265147/
[17:11:28] <praveenkumar> next
[17:11:31] <code_geek> does www[001:006].example.com mean that there are 6 hosts? numbered from 1 to 6?
[17:11:42] <avik> praveenkumar, strangely enough, ls in ansible dir. shows hosts
[17:11:54] <sandeepkk> praveenkumar: i think they have to do cd /etc/ansible/ and than type cat hosts to see the content
[17:11:56] <radhikaa> @abstatic. ok.:)
[17:12:44] <praveenkumar> code_geek: yes right
[17:13:03] <code_geek> ok
[17:13:08] <avik> ok, got it, doing vi
[17:13:11] <abstatic> praveenkumar, what are groups here ?
[17:13:26] <praveenkumar> lets now discuss about groups and un-group stuff.
[17:14:18] <pabitra> can I know what all have been discussed till now, as I got disconnected ?
[17:14:47] <praveenkumar> so assume I have 20 db server and I want to install a patch to all those server or I want same config for all those server to I will create a group call [dbserver] and then list down hostname/IP for those.
[17:15:24] <sandeepkk> pabitra: https://da.gd/GdwCN
[17:15:24] <praveenkumar> then I will just say ansible dbserver -m ping (which will only ping my db servers not any other group)
[17:15:43] <praveenkumar> Same way I can have frontend group also
[17:15:49] <pabitra> Trhanks alot sandeepkk :)
[17:16:26] <praveenkumar> Good thing about grouping is it will make things clean and easy to identify.
[17:17:34] <hydro>  [WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available
[17:17:56] <hydro> on running ansible dbserver -m ping
[17:17:56] <praveenkumar> Now try to do one thing in your host file where you added localhost before that put [webserver]
[17:18:17] <praveenkumar> hydro: because you don't have any dbserver group yet.
[17:18:23] <avik> with the []?
[17:18:27] <praveenkumar> yes
[17:18:38] <avik> ok thanks
[17:18:50] <praveenkumar> now when you done try to execute $ ansible webserver -i hosts -m ping
[17:19:29] <hydro> Now try to do one thing in your host file where you added localhost before that put [webserver] ? what are you trying to say
[17:19:34] <praveenkumar> So instead of "all" which mean (group + non-group) we used a specific group.
[17:19:46] <praveenkumar> hydro: we are putting our localhost under a group
[17:20:17] <praveenkumar> hydro: currently it is a stand alone host (Ungrouped host)
[17:20:52] <praveenkumar> Everyone got that?
[17:21:00] <code_geek> yes
[17:21:12] <mahesh5> yes
[17:21:17] <sandeepkk> yes :)
[17:21:30] <jargonmonk> yes
[17:21:54] <mbtamuli12_> yes
[17:22:04] <hydro>  [WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available
[17:22:08] <abstatic> yes, finally :)
[17:22:28] <praveenkumar> Great so we discussed about inventory and ad-hoc run. Next session we will discuss about playbook and then tell you how we can create a playbook with different task and execute.
[17:22:52] <punarvasu510> praveenkumar: what has to be done in the hosts file?
[17:22:56] <avik> praveenkumar, is it ok t get what hydro just showed ^^?
[17:22:57] <praveenkumar> Also we will write playbook for all step which we listed today in the begin of this session.
[17:23:24] <avik> *t/to
[17:24:03] <praveenkumar> avik: hydro http://paste.fedoraproject.org/406261/9290171/ this is what you folks should get.
[17:24:13] <gobinda> praveenkumar, I goe an error http://paste.fedoraproject.org/406262/92901814/
[17:24:47] <mbtamuli12_> praveenkumar, what is the tool you use to install and set-up an OS on a bare-metal, before all the ansible stuff can be done.
[17:24:54] <praveenkumar> As a homework you folks check http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_intro.html and whatever interest you (ansible have huge documentation)
[17:25:01] <punarvasu510> nevermind.i got it
[17:25:45] <praveenkumar> gobinda: because you put [webserver] and localhost in same line put it in the different line
[17:25:51] <mbtamuli12_> I have played around with playbooks. :) More specifically, LAMP setup.
[17:26:37] <hydro> done
[17:26:49] <gobinda> praveenkumar, it done thank you
[17:27:03] <praveenkumar> mbtamuli12_: baremetal provision is something different and when you have bare minimal OS up you can use ansible to do all sort of stuff.
[17:27:25] <praveenkumar> Anyone have any more questions?
[17:28:29] <praveenkumar> Alright so I am going to close this session
