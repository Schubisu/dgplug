[15:46:04] <kushal> Only interested people will stay back.
[15:46:15] <kushal> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/397290/raw/  This is your problem

[15:48:49] <kushal> chshbh, if you can read all the logs, and find this out, you are most welcome :)
[15:49:36] <chshbh> kushal, no but making it 100% automated is not easy :/
[15:50:11] <kushal> chshbh, feel free to copy and paste the logs into 4 different string variables.
[15:50:16] <kushal> and then you can code :)
[15:50:34] <chshbh> kushal, okay :D
[15:50:44] <kushal> Q: How do you find if x is talking to y or talking about y?
[15:50:53] <kushal> Can anyone answer me that?
[15:51:18] <sidhant> Sidhant Gupta
[15:51:26] <Onkar> Roll call : Onkar Karale
[15:51:48] <LambaInsaan> kushal, whenever someone mentions someone in the given list of nicks it means two people are talking.
[15:51:57] <abhishekg5> I think first we'll need list of all the names of people here on channel
[15:52:12] <meamitk> Roll Call Amit Kokitkar

[15:53:19] <kushal> LambaInsaan, correct :)
[15:53:42] <LambaInsaan> :)
[15:53:55] <rohan_h> kushal, i will store the logs in a file and read line by line.. If two nicks are there on a line, they are talking. First nick is talking to second nick.
[15:54:04] <kushal> LambaInsaan, but see, others are not saying anything.
[15:54:10] <kushal> rohan_h, yes
[15:54:35] <rahuldecoded_> Roll call : Rahul Bhattacharjee
[15:55:15] <LambaInsaan> kushal, Haha. :p
[15:55:49] <rl56> Roll call:Varsha R
[15:56:22] <mahesh5> Roll call:Mahesh
[15:56:39] <avik> but kushal check this line:
[15:56:41] <avik> kushal, rohan_h, batul is a bot
[15:56:41] <avik> here I talked to kushal and rohan_h about batul
[15:56:42] <priyanka> kushal, but if x says that "y is curious to learn things"  then it means that x is talking "about" y although x mentioned y's name.
[15:57:01] <kushal> priyanka, count that in.
[15:57:14] <kushal> avik, yes, you talked to two people once
[15:57:23] <kushal> so the count to both person will go up :)
[15:57:52] <chshbh> avik, its about mentioning a nick, rather than talking to/about the nick. :)
[15:57:54] <priyanka> okay kushal.
[15:58:57] <abhishekg5> kushal: maybe regex can be used. We'll need to check if there is a nick(from a list of all the nicks) after <x>, means, x is talking. But this won't include the cases where people address nicks anywhere except <>
[15:59:07] <rhnvrm> Roll call: rohan verma
[15:59:28] <pksadiq> kushal: but I think priyanka actually said something too much complicated than you thought,
[15:59:28] <pksadiq> like the one I said above, I didn't actually talked to priyanka, tho her name is there ;)
[16:00:04] <avik> yes but how to exclude batul? it makes me talking to it also?
[16:00:09] <avik> kushal, ^^
[16:00:32] <jogender> kushal do we have to include batul also?
[16:00:32] <abhishekg5> Checking each word from each nicks from lengthy logs can be a bad algo
[16:01:02] <poonam> so if y is in between the line it means x is talking about y but if y is next to x it means x is talking with y
[16:01:35] <abhishekg5> avik: 1(batul's) case can be neglected
[16:01:50] <shobhitupadhyay> we use another nick name to address third one..but actually i not talking to that nick
[16:02:10] <avik> batul is just an example! abhishekg5
[16:02:39] <rahuldecoded_> For a particular nick(A), I will count the occurrence of nick(B), whenever nick(A) mentioned nick(B)
[16:02:42] <rhnvrm> kushal, we can have a dict of usernames mapped to dict of usernames to count {kushal:{avik:53, gkdam: 55},...}
[16:02:56] <LambaInsaan> Only mentions count in or something in between messages also counts in? Some IRC clients use ',' as separator and some use ':' as a separator. I am confused with this problem.
[16:03:09] <LambaInsaan> rhnvrm, I was thinking the same!
[16:05:08] <rhnvrm> guys i missed the logs, do we have to code this problem?
[16:05:57] <abhishekg5> rhnvrm: yeah. Eventually.
[16:06:08] <kushal> abhishekg5, skip regex :)
[16:06:56] <kushal> jogender, avik batul is a valid nick
[16:07:13] <kushal> chshbh, count the mentions as talking
[16:07:28] <avik> ok :)
[16:07:55] <mbtamuli12_> Roll Call: Mriyam Tamuli
[16:08:03] <mbtamuli12_> Doing the task.
[16:10:13] <jargonmonk> Roll Call:Aniket
[16:14:04] <PrashantJ> Someone please explain what editing is required with logs in gedit? If I want to iterate line by line?
[16:14:27] <rahuldecoded_> kushal, can I do that, this weekend? I have to go through the logs. I could not attend due to my Exam.
[16:14:31] <PrashantJ> I am trying to edit in gedit and paste to python interpreter
[16:15:42] <PrashantJ> I want to use >>> lines.split("\n")
[16:18:24] <kushal> rahuldecoded_, okay
[16:18:30] <kushal> rest should try to do this now
[16:19:51] <avik> kushal, do we need a list of all the names present?
[16:20:02] <kushal> avik, yes,
[16:20:13] <kushal> means first you have to find out who all spoke in the logs
[16:20:25] <avik> and where will we get that?
[16:20:25] <kushal> and make a list (or better) a dict of those nicks
[16:20:32] <kushal> avik, in the logs,
[16:20:39] <kushal> avik, you will have to write code for that
[16:20:42] <kushal> So
[16:20:55] <kushal> For any problem, first try to split it into smaller problems
[16:21:09] <kushal> 1. First get the logs in 4 strings.
[16:21:18] <kushal> log1, log2, log3, log4
[16:21:20] <kushal> and then
[16:21:47] <kushal> 2. For each log, find who spoke the line, get all the names as keys in a dict.
[16:22:14] <iKshitij> kushal could you please clarify the question.
[16:22:25] <kushal> 3. For each log, find who spoke the line, and which all nicks are present in the line, increment the count.
[16:22:42] <kushal> Who can help iKshitij here so that he can understand the problem better?
[16:22:50] pksadiq` is now known as pksadiq
[16:23:18] <abhishekg5> iKshitij: What part of question you didn't understand ?
[16:23:30] <kushal> abhishekg5, thanks.
[16:23:43] <iKshitij> kushal: continue ! Got it in your explanation !
[16:24:12] <iKshitij> Thank you abhishekg5
[16:24:33] <avik> :) thank you kushal for the algorithm :)
[16:25:01] <PrashantJ> kushal, https://paste.fedoraproject.org/397302/ Please have a look at this.
[16:25:44] <kushal> PrashantJ, yours copy paste is wrong.
[16:26:00] <kushal> You are supposed to copy from the file, so that you can get \n for new lines
[16:26:30] <PrashantJ> Ohh okay kushal thanks:)
[16:29:21] <moizsajid> !
[16:30:57] <kushal> next
[16:31:00] <kushal> next
[16:32:27] <moizsajid> Can you please tell me what task are we doing?
[16:33:26] <abhishekg5> moizsajid: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/397290/raw/
[16:33:53] <aman-> !
[16:33:58] <abhishekg5> moizsajid: ^ Try solving this problem
[16:33:59] <code_geek> kushal, we have to find the count for each log separately or all four combined
[16:34:03] <code_geek> sorry
[16:34:05] <code_geek> !
[16:34:12] <moizsajid> abhishekg5: Thanks!
[16:34:27] <kushal> code_geek, all :)
[16:34:38] <kushal> next
[16:34:41] <kushal> next
[16:34:47] <code_geek> okay, thanks
[16:34:49] <kushal> Do not type ! today, just ask :)
[16:34:56] <aman-> if i want to read from file where to store the file
[16:35:12] <aman-> it is showing no such file or directory
[16:36:51] <mbtamuli12_> kushal, Why did batul mention this nick, 'mbtamuli12' although I am not currently using that nick and no "!" was given by from that nick.
[16:37:05] <mbtamuli12_> "mbtamuli12 please ask your question.. moizsajid you are next. Get ready with your question."
[16:38:04] <SRvSaha> Roll Call : SRvSaha
[16:38:08] <abhishekg5> aman-: first download the 4 log files and save it in your working directory. Make the .py file in the same directory where other txt files are saved.
[16:38:33] <darkside_> It should be in the same directory where your file cointaing the sourse code..
[16:38:34] <kushal> Btw, here is one resume https://www.zeemee.com/aasimsani
[16:38:50] <aman-> abhishekg5, thanks
[16:38:57] <moizsajid> mbtamuli12: There might be a bug :)
[16:39:31] <akash47> mbtamuli12_, previous class queue.
[16:46:31] <abhishekg5> kushal: Multiple talents. But what is the job he's looking for through the resume ? Mountaineering ? Programming ? Musician ?
[16:47:25] <kushal> abhishekg5, college admission :)
[16:47:32] <Aazad> !
[16:47:59] <avik> what?????
[16:48:06] <avik> :O
[16:48:15] <shobhitupadhyay> very attractive and different resume.
[16:48:27] <Aazad> guys , today session get over ???
[16:48:49] <avik> Aazad, not yet
[16:49:40] <Aazad> what is today's topic ?
[16:50:21] <rhnvrm> to download all log files into a folder you can use wget -r https://dgplug.org/irclogs/2016/ --no-parent
[16:50:34] <jargonmonk> Aazad: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/397290/raw/
[16:51:22] <abstatic> jargonmonk, is that an assignment ?
[16:52:29] <abhishekg5> kushal: Okay, good one then :)
[16:53:55] <jargonmonk> abstatic: yes.
[16:55:33] <Aazad> kushal : at what , session will start ?
[16:56:33] <PrashantJ> Aazad, It already has started
[16:56:48] <PrashantJ> Aazad, https://paste.fedoraproject.org/397290/raw/
[16:56:57] <PrashantJ> ^^ solve this problem for the day
[17:01:17] <Aazad> PrashantJ : this is the link where i was in last time
[17:04:57] <pabitra> can I know what i missed ?
[17:06:35] <avik> kushal,
[17:07:45] <chshbh> kushal, if we would be using list instead of dictionary, we will require 2 lists right? one to maintain nick other to maintain the counter/ occurences
[17:08:13] <vbhjain> please help, how can I know whether a word is nick of someone or not?
[17:08:19] <pabitra> kushal, do we need to find in 4 logs or one would work ?
[17:08:53] <avik> in dic[name]=dic.get[name,confusion]   confusion==0 or confusion==NULL ? for string(name2)?
[17:10:12] <avik> sayan? kushal? fhackdroid? anybody? ^^
[17:13:26] <sayan> avik: did not get you
[17:13:35] <akash47> avik, python has None instead of NULL
[17:14:04] <sayan> avik: get is a method so you need to use () instead of []
[17:14:32] <kushal>  avik there is no NULL in Python
[17:14:39] <kushal> chshbh, yes
[17:15:14] <pabitra> kushal, one query
[17:15:28] <avik> Sayan while creating a dic.  what should be the default value for Valule part if it is suppose to be a string? 0?
[17:15:40] <avik> kushal, ^^
[17:15:46] <pabitra> there are few lines as well where no on'e name is mentioned, that should be ignored right??
[17:16:08] <kushal> avik, dict
[17:16:15] <kushal> avik, integer 0
[17:16:19] <kushal> pabitra, yes
[17:16:21] <vbhjain> kushal ,  how can I know whether a word is nick of someone or not in the line ?
[17:16:36] <kushal> vbhjain, write code to find that out :)
[17:16:37] <avik> ok thank you kushal
[17:16:50] <kushal> Who wants to tell vbhjain how to find if a word is a nick or not?
[17:17:13] <pabitra> so like the above converstaion you mentioned vbhjain's name so that would be counted as one conversation
[17:17:20] <pabitra> i will help vbhjain kushal
[17:18:00] <chshbh> vbhjain, precompute them and store in list and then match it maybe
[17:19:18] <rohan_h> avik, string=" " . This means null. Right?
[17:19:28] <shauryak_3> vbhjain, you can also straight away store the names during the roll call in a list
[17:19:34] <rohan_h> In Python only ^
[17:20:01] <avik> should mean that :)
[17:20:07] <avik> rohan_h, ^^
[17:20:54] <pabitra> anyone please clear me on the above question
[17:21:05] <kushal> pabitra, yes
[17:21:30] <kushal> Everyone should create a github repo for this, name the repo as dgplugproblems :)
[17:23:51] <pabitra> but kushal sometimes in a converstaion not necessarily the nick's name is mentioned at first (like in this one) I mentioned your name after 'but'
[17:24:11] <pabitra> or do we need to search the whole line for nick names
[17:24:27] <rohan_h> Yes pabitra
[17:25:32] <pabitra> rohan_h, yes for  ?
[17:26:26] <shauryak_3> pabitra, i guess if we are looking for conversations as whole then obviously we will have to search the whole line .
[17:27:40] <rohan_h> There will be two functions to enter both names, now we will scan line by line.. If both are there, first nick is talking to second. It will have a counter, which will be increased by one. I can't code because i don't have my laptop now.
[17:28:31] <rohan_h> But if there are multiple nicks in a line, it will not work.
[17:33:50] <pabitra> kushal, one more doubt ?
[17:34:18] <LambaInsaan> Done!
[17:36:08] <pabitra> LambaInsaan, can you tell me if we are doing this by putting the all 4 logs into single string?
[17:36:31] <rohan_h> pabitra use file
[17:36:48] <LambaInsaan> I am using different string for each log.
[17:36:53] <LambaInsaan> pabitra, ^
[17:36:56] <code_geek> kushal: check this: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/397339/  is it correct?
[17:37:21] <code_geek> here log1, log2, log3, log4 are the logs of 4 days
[17:41:19] <vharsh> topic
[17:41:28] <vharsh> oops
[17:45:51] <abhi2016> @code_geek is it running?
[17:46:37] <code_geek> yes abhi2016 , wait, I'll show you the output.
[17:48:05] <code_geek> abhi2016, https://paste.fedoraproject.org/397349/
[17:48:45] <code_geek> I ran the program in ubuntu terminal, that's why the output comes in the form of tuples
[17:49:47] <code_geek> If I run it in any online IDE like geeksforgeeks, it says the output is too large. It works in online IDEs only when i take the log of 1 day
[17:50:09] <abhi2016> @code_geek congrats
[17:50:26] <code_geek> thanks abhi2016 :)
[17:51:47] <avik> kushal are you there?
[17:58:03] <code_geek> kushal, is the session over?
[18:05:56] <kushal> I am here
[18:06:04] <kushal> code_geek, I should close it formally
[18:07:07] <shauryak_3> kushal, do we need to show the result/program here or directly on github repo?
[18:07:24] <kushal> add to the repo
[18:07:37] <LambaInsaan> kushal, which repo?
[18:07:46] rahuldecoded is now known as Guest79404
[18:07:54] <kushal> LambaInsaan, you create one in github
[18:07:58] <kushal> dgplugproblems
[18:08:12] trishnag is now known as trishnag|afk
[18:08:14] <LambaInsaan> kushal, alright!
[18:08:45] <shauryak_3> kushal, okay thanks.
[18:09:06] <SRvSaha> code_geek: Done with the code ?
