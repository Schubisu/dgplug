[16:31:00] <kushal> thisisashwani, hehe, nothing to be sorry about. We all do mistakes.
[16:31:11] <avik> code:
[16:31:21] <D1mz> Is there any particular reason to use rst other than that it is used in python community?
[16:31:34] <thisisashwani> kushal: still i wanted to know is there an easier way to make grids
[16:31:46] <avik> code: paste.fedoraproject.org/385893/
[16:31:48] <thisisashwani> the ways i am making it, it seems to me i am doing it wrong!
[16:31:49] <kushal> thisisashwani, I don't know actually :(
[16:31:58] <thisisashwani> kushal: okay!
[16:32:04] <D1mz> I mean we have alternatives like markdown

[16:32:15] <kushal> D1mz, I use it because I am doing it for a long time, and it does what I want, and it is easy

[16:33:31] <kushal> next
[16:33:46] <thisisashwani> SRvSaha: seems more like a problem of indentation, you mixed tabs and spaces?
[16:34:10] <SRvSaha> thisisashwani: I am not seeing py as C, C++ and Java in output
[16:34:14] <avik> see in the 1st paragraph, the lines are all collasped!
[16:34:36] <avik> although i have blank lines
[16:34:40] <kushal> avik, when you are pasting, you should paste with https:// that way we can click
[16:35:07] <avik> very sorry kushal
[16:35:12] <SRvSaha> thisisashwani: So, what should it be. Should there be equal indentation between the arg and the description

[16:41:36] <sanket> SRvSaha: yes, if you still encounter issues, lets talk after class.
[16:42:02] <kushal> next
[16:42:08] <kushal> next
[16:42:18] <SRvSaha> ;)
[16:42:29] <akshays> what was the last command you entered in terminal
[16:43:10] <buvanesh_kumar> what is it? https://shellshare.net/r/summertraining ? i did't understand.
[16:43:12] <kushal> akshays, less
[16:43:19] <buvanesh_kumar> There is no coding
[16:43:21] <akshays> was it less avik.rst ?
[16:43:36] <buvanesh_kumar> same question akshays ;)
[16:43:39] <kushal> buvanesh_kumar, yes, it is a live view of what I am doing
[16:43:45] <rahul_bajaj> buvanesh_kumar, it is kushal terminal which he can share with shellshare.
[16:43:45] <kushal> akshays, yes
[16:43:55] <akshays> thanks :)
[16:44:09] <akshays> kushal
[16:44:12] <buvanesh_kumar> i known that thing. but inside the terminal content i did't understand
[16:44:39] <kushal> Okay
[16:45:02] <kushal> Can anyone tell me why are we learning about documentation first?
[16:45:12] <kushal> Even before we are learning to code
[16:45:13] <buvanesh_kumar> i am asking about  avik.rst file contents kushal
[16:45:25] <kushal> buvanesh_kumar, he pasted that few minutes back
[16:45:31] <mr-karan> because great docs help in the long run, for others to see and maintain the code we write
[16:45:42] <rohan_h> kushal, because documentation helps us to easily read the code
[16:45:49] <kushal> Correct.
[16:46:02] <c0mrad3> kushal: documentation is important and not as difficult as coding
[16:46:06] <kushal> But documentation is the way someone else will choose if they want to use the code you write or not/
[16:46:13] <buvanesh_kumar> It helps to understand, kushal
[16:46:25] <deep123k> Because it helps with getting started with project development
[16:46:25] <kushal> c0mrad3, it is important, but in times it comes as difficult as coding.
[16:46:35] <akorep_> !
[16:46:41] <kushal> Unless one understands the subject, that person can not do any documentation.
[16:46:47] <kushal> next
[16:47:06] <akorep_> So, are we supposed to follow this form of documentation?
[16:47:07] <pabitra> !
[16:47:45] <kushal> akorep_, It is one way of doing it.
[16:47:57] <kushal> There are various styles, you can choose whatever you like.
[16:48:01] <kushal> next
[16:48:11] <pabitra> hi kushal
[16:48:16] <kushal> ?
[16:48:24] <pabitra> i am trying to implement grid table
[16:48:28] <akorep_> kushal, thanks!
[16:48:36] <pabitra> it is whowing line error
[16:48:53] <pabitra> and while pasting it to pastebin it is getting messed up
[16:48:58] <pabitra> the table structure
[16:49:08] <pabitra> how can i show it to you??
[16:49:44] <mr-karan> paste.fedoraproject.com pabitra
[16:49:52] <kushal> pabitra, ^^^
[16:50:07] <pabitra> mr-karan, did you read what i typed
[16:50:09] <pksadiq> kushal: you may probably add '.enter' command for batul that would trigger the same as: /msg fsbot enter
[16:50:22] <c0mrad3> kushal: IMHO coding is a tough one than documentation, but I agree that one should understand the software for writing the documentation which is also a tough job
[16:50:47] <Rnarwade> How to open .rst file by command
[16:50:48] <pabitra> mr-karan, i am trying to paste it to there.. but on pasting it is getting messed up
[16:51:12] <kushal> c0mrad3, and then think about documentation of the development process or any new project, which can only be done by experienced people.
[16:51:15] <moizsajid> Rnarwade, vi test.rst
[16:51:24] <kushal> pabitra, still show us that one only
[16:51:29] <kushal> next
[16:51:35] <Onkar> Onkar karale
[16:51:35] <Onkar> Sry i am late
[16:51:43] <kushal> Onkar, what is Sry?
[16:51:51] <kushal> Onkar, is that Fry?
[16:52:38] * c0mrad3 kushal I agree
[16:52:53] <kushal> next
[16:52:57] <kushal> Okay
[16:52:59] <Silenced> Onkar: Fallow the etiqutte of IRC when chatting here.
[16:53:20] <kushal> So in the Python world we use a project/tool called sphinx to create the documentation
[16:54:15] <kushal> Today we will learn sphinx
[16:54:17] <pabitra> !
[16:54:20] <kushal> You can use it for most cases
[16:54:23] HoloIRCUser is now known as jogi96_
[16:54:33] <kushal> http://summertraining.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ this is done using sphinx
[16:54:37] <kushal> next
[16:54:54] <pabitra> what is the difference between table and grid table
[16:55:00] <pabitra> because both looks alike
[16:55:14] <rahul_bajaj> !
[16:55:15] <pabitra> is only difference of spanned cells ??
[16:55:50] <kushal> I think they are same,
[16:56:00] <kushal> the difference is in how you write them
[16:56:01] <kushal> next
[16:56:04] <rahul_bajaj> kushal, python for you and me is written using sphinx ?
[16:56:18] <kushal> rahul_bajaj, yes
[16:56:21] <rahul_bajaj> okay.
[16:56:28] <rahul_bajaj> <eof>
[16:57:13] <kushal> The general idea is that we will have a docs directory inside any project, and we will create the documentation there
[16:57:23] <thisisashwani> kushal, pabitra: isn't the other diff is that in grid cells, you can span multiple columns?
[16:57:36] <akorep_> kushal, Can I leave now? I'll be back within half an hour.
[16:57:42] <kushal> akorep_, yes, you can
[16:57:47] <kushal> For today's class, we will call our project hellodgplug
[16:58:05] <kushal> thisisashwani, yes, the way you can put details on the table are different
[16:58:32] <thisisashwani> kushal: okay!
[16:58:39] <pabitra> thisisashwani,  yes that's what i said... spanning across row and colummns
[16:58:55] <thisisashwani> pabitra: oh, i missed that.
[16:59:17] <kushal> Look at the https://shellshare.net/r/summertraining
[16:59:23] <kushal> Everyone
[17:00:07] <Richard15> looking
[17:02:17] <pksadiq> kushal: PS1='\w $ ' is better I think
[17:02:40] <avik> anything happinging there? am i missing out ?
[17:04:45] <vharsh> Wow, this link works on tablets :)
[17:05:21] <pabitra> !
[17:05:33] <kushal> Now everyone please look at this very carefully
[17:05:34] <kushal> next
[17:05:42] <pabitra> http://paste.fedoraproject.org/385918/14671263/
[17:05:57] <kushal> pabitra, can we please do this after the session?
[17:05:57] <pabitra> sorry I missed the shellshare things
[17:06:01] <pabitra> yeah sure
[17:06:06] <pabitra> sorry
[17:06:11] <kushal> back to the shell
[17:07:41] <kushal> I enter n only to the last question
[17:07:56] <kushal> where I do not want to have the windows .bat file, but you can have that too
[17:08:51] <kushal> If your documentation needs to be build on windows, keep that to y
[17:09:04] <kushal> Now can everyone do the same on their computer
[17:09:13] <kushal> ?
[17:09:20] <c0mrad3> !

[17:20:09] <thisisashwani> kushal: i missed the first few things on your terminal, did you separate source and build directories?
[17:20:29] <pabitra> kushal, i did all those steps... will it create a doc file ??
[17:21:30] <pabitra> thisisashwani, scroll it
[17:21:31] <rohan_h> pabitra, go to the directory and check yourself
[17:21:36] <pabitra> you can scroll it up
[17:21:58] <pabitra> yes... i checked... rohan_h only config and make files are present

[17:29:12] <SRvSaha> kushal: Should I first go to _build/toctrees and then do Make html ? I am getting this warning "/home/srvsaha/hellodgplug/docs/firstchapter.rst:: WARNING: document isn't included in any toctree"
[17:29:23] <abstatic> !
[17:29:44] <kushal> SRvSaha, see which directory I am in, also you have to add the firstchapter file in the index.rst
[17:29:50] <kushal> SRvSaha, watch the scrren
[17:29:54] <kushal> screen
[17:30:15] <kushal> After 3 spaces, I wrote the name of the file without the extension
[17:30:31] <SRvSaha> 3 spaces. I gave 4 :(
[17:31:02] <abstatic> so we have to keep our chapters in a separate doc folder ?
[17:31:42] <SRvSaha> !
[17:32:04] <kushal> SRvSaha, :)
[17:32:08] <SRvSaha> Kushal : Can you please do it again from the beginning ?
[17:32:26] <SRvSaha> I missed something
[17:32:28] <kushal> abstatic, no you have to keep them in the same directory with other docs files.
[17:32:38] <kushal> SRvSaha, what is the error are you getting?
[17:32:43] <SRvSaha> I am getting warning : /home/srvsaha/hellodgplug/docs/index.rst:11: WARNING: toctree contains reference to document u'firstchapter' that doesn't have a title: no link will be generated

[17:33:21] <kushal> SRvSaha, look now
[17:33:24] <abstatic> kushal, got it
[17:33:56] <SRvSaha> Oh ok. Got it. Thanks Ku

[17:34:20] <kushal> abstatic, done
[17:34:21] <abstatic> thank you.
[17:34:53] <kushal> Any more question on this ?

[17:35:57] <warlord77> !
[17:35:57] <pabitra> solved
[17:36:00] <abstatic> i also get the warning - /home/ubuntu/dev/coding/python/doctest/firstchapter.rst:: WARNING: document isn't included in any toctree
[17:36:02] <kushal> abstatic, yes, you are missing the chapter title on the top
[17:36:05] <prashaant__> please share the link to live terminal , i got disconnected and had to login from another computer
[17:36:14] <SRvSaha> kushal: Thanks I am done. It's working fine now.
[17:36:20] <SRvSaha> !
[17:36:20] <kushal> abstatic, then you don't have it in the index.rst
[17:36:22] <kushal> next
[17:36:26] <akshays> how to create first chapter
[17:36:35] <SRvSaha> kushal: Is the make file directly doing the work of rst2html ?
[17:36:40] <kushal> prashaant_, https://shellshare.net/r/summertraining
[17:36:41] <SRvSaha> <eof>
[17:36:49] <amitk_> kushal thanks i allways amazed how people can manage big Project documentation, and in couple of this lecture i came to know the secret :)
[17:36:49] <kushal> SRvSaha, sphinx is doing that work
[17:37:02] <kushal> amitk_, nothing secret in this :)
[17:37:05] <prashaant__> thanks kushal.
[17:37:07] <kushal> next
[17:37:11] <deep123k> After creating firstchapter.rst how did you build
[17:37:26] <kushal> deep123k, scroll up, I gave the command
[17:37:27] <kushal> make html
[17:37:28] <kushal> next
[17:37:39] <akshay_CV> akshays: vim firstchapter.rst
[17:37:52] <abstatic> kushal, i found what i did wrong. I had slightly differnt file names in index.rst and the actual file created. renaming solved the problem! :)
[17:37:52] <kushal> next
[17:37:52] <warlord77> kushal, to make it into html we have to use the same command as we used in rest
[17:37:55] <SRvSaha> !
[17:38:09] <deep123k> !
[17:38:12] <kushal> warlord77, give the following command
[17:38:14] <kushal> make html
[17:38:14] <kushal> next
[17:38:51] <kushal> next
[17:39:01] <deep123k> Make html is giving error : no rule to make target 'html'
[17:39:09] <avik> !
[17:39:14] <kushal> deep123k, which directory are you in?
[17:39:17] <kushal> next
[17:39:26] <avik> what to do after doing make html?
[17:39:38] <kushal> the files are in _build/html directory
[17:39:40] <avik> how to view what we did?
[17:39:41] <SRvSaha> kushal: Suppose I have 10 html files with 8 previously built using make. Now for the last 2, if I am doing make html, will all the html files be build or just the latest ones? <eof>
[17:39:46] <kushal> OPen your browser to view them
[17:39:55] <kushal> SRvSaha, try and see :)
[17:40:02] <kushal> avik, open firefox
[17:40:02] <code_geek> !
[17:40:06] <kushal> and then in my case
[17:40:27] <kushal> file:///home/fedora/hellodgplug/docs/_build/html
[17:40:31] <kushal> I open this path
[17:40:32] <kushal> next
[17:40:35] <code_geek> We have to run the make html command every time we edit a project or create one?
[17:40:44] <kushal> code_geek, every time you update the docs
[17:40:52] <code_geek> okay
[17:40:52] <kushal> code_geek, we can get it done automatically
[17:40:58] <kushal> we will learn about it later
[17:41:06] <code_geek> okay :)
[17:41:12] <akshays> !
[17:41:14] <avik> cool
[17:41:17] <avik> :)
[17:41:21] <kushal> If you see closely this docs already has a search engine for you.
[17:41:22] <kushal> next
[17:41:50] <akshays> i saw the index.html in browser but it doesnot look like the one you showed
[17:42:26] <kushal> akshays, I did not show you my index.html
[17:42:52] <akshays> i mean the dgplug python one
[17:43:20] <avik> !
[17:43:29] <kushal> akshays, yes, as it depends on the theme
[17:43:34] <kushal> they may look different
[17:43:36] <kushal> next
[17:43:39] <akshays> its just pain html page
[17:43:48] <code_geek> !
[17:43:55] <c0mrad3> !
[17:44:01] <kushal> akshays, may be you want to update your sphinx
[17:44:01] <kushal> next
[17:44:02] <avik> we do need to understand each prompt of sphinx we passed by enter , right?
[17:44:04] <code_geek> We have to convert firstproject.rst using rst2html command? Because I cannot find firstproject.html after make html.
[17:44:16] <kushal> avik, yes, but not right now
[17:44:26] <avik> ok
[17:44:28] <kushal> code_geek, it is under _build/html
[17:44:33] <kushal> code_geek, see the terminal
[17:44:48] <pabitra> code_geek, go to _build folder inside where you have the rst file
[17:44:52] <kushal> next
[17:44:54] <c0mrad3> kushal: can you cat both the files in shellshare once
[17:44:56] <code_geek> okay, thanks
[17:45:12] <kushal> c0mrad3, these two, correct?
[17:45:19] <c0mrad3> yes
[17:45:41] <kushal> c0mrad3, is this okay?
[17:45:45] <c0mrad3> kushal: yes
[17:46:15] <kushal> Okay

[17:49:46] <kushal> next
[17:49:48] <real56> Do we have to create the index and  firstchapter .rst page inside _build or is it okay to create outside of it?
[17:50:04] <kushal> real56, you don't have to create index.rst
[17:50:10] <kushal> see my directory

[17:50:45] <kushal> make latexpdf
[17:50:46] <chshbh> sorry kushal, i missed the session today, i had appointment with doctor. Thanks,
[17:50:57] <kushal> but for that you need many latex packages installed.
[17:51:03] <kushal> chshbh, No problem

[17:51:07] <deep123k> Kushal you did y for all except last two ..right?
[17:52:00] <kushal> Pasting here for logs
[17:52:01] <kushal> $ sphinx-quickstart
[17:52:01] <kushal> Welcome to the Sphinx 1.2.3 quickstart utility.
[17:52:01] <kushal> Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
[17:52:01] <kushal> accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).
[17:52:01] <kushal> Enter the root path for documentation.
[17:52:02] <kushal> > Root path for the documentation [.]:
[17:52:07] <kushal> You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
[17:52:08] <kushal> Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
[17:52:12] <kushal> "source" and "build" directories within the root path.
[17:52:14] <kushal> > Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]:
[17:52:16] <kushal> Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
[17:52:19] <kushal> for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
[17:52:20] <kushal> files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
[17:52:22] <kushal> > Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]:
[17:52:24] <kushal> The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
[17:52:28] <kushal> > Project name: Our hello dgplug
[17:52:30] <kushal> > Author name(s): Kushal Das <kushaldas@gmail.com>
[17:52:32] <kushal> Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
[17:52:36] <kushal> software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
[17:52:38] <kushal> Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
[17:52:42] <kushal> something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1.  If you don't need this dual structure,
[17:52:44] <kushal> just set both to the same value.
[17:52:46] <kushal> > Project version: 0.1
[17:52:48] <kushal> > Project release [0.1]:
[17:52:50] <kushal> The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
[17:52:52] <kushal> or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
[17:52:54] <kushal> > Source file suffix [.rst]:
[17:52:58] <kushal> One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
[17:53:00] <kushal> "contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
[17:53:02] <kushal> of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
[17:53:06] <kushal> document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
[17:53:08] <kushal> > Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]:
[17:53:12] <kushal> Sphinx can also add configuration for epub output:
[17:53:14] <kushal> > Do you want to use the epub builder (y/n) [n]:
[17:53:16] <kushal> Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:
[17:53:18] <kushal> > autodoc: automatically insert docstri
[17:53:21] <kushal> Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:

[17:53:46] <kushal> A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
[17:53:48] <kushal> only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build

[17:54:04] <kushal> Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.
[17:54:08] <kushal> You should now populate your master file ./index.rst and create other documentation
[17:54:12] <kushal> source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
[17:54:15] <kushal>    make builder
[17:54:16] <kushal> where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.
[17:54:18] <kushal> and then do make html
[17:54:20] <kushal> for the rest ask help here from friends
[17:54:22] <kushal> You should try to help others, the easiest way to learn more.
[17:54:24] <kushal> See you all tomorrow
