[16:21:20] <kushal> Before we start, any question on Python till now?
[16:21:36] <deep123k> Deepanshu kapoor
[16:22:09] <vharsh> Harsh Vardhan
[16:22:14] <LambaInsaan> Rhitik Bhatt
[16:22:26] <kushal> So no questions.
[16:22:31] <kushal> Today's topic: Files
[16:23:08] <aman_> Roll call : Aman Kumar
[16:24:25] <kushal> For normal usage we have two different types of files, text files, and binary files for different formats.
[16:24:35] <kushal> Can you type some names for text files?
[16:24:50] <kushal> Also type some names for binary files :)
[16:25:04] <tasin> .docx file
[16:25:31] <kushal> tasin, what kind?
[16:25:37] <kushal> What about .mp3 and .jpg?
[16:25:42] <kushal> What about .py files?
[16:25:44] <aman_> .txt and .bin
[16:25:54] <kushal> aman_, which one is what? :)
[16:26:15] <aman_> .txt is for text and .bin for binary
[16:26:27] <kushal> Okay
[16:26:30] <kushal> Anyone else?
[16:26:31] <aman_> :)
[16:26:51] <kushal> What about .mp3 and .jpg?
[16:26:53] <kushal> What about .py files?
[16:27:04] <kushal> others tell us what do you think.
[16:27:10] <kushal> Feel free to use google.com :)
[16:27:15] <code_geek> .mp3 and .jpg is binary
[16:27:25] <abhishekg5> .py is text. .mp3 and .jpg binary
[16:27:32] <sandeepk> .mp3 or .jpg are binary files as open any editior see 0 and 1
[16:27:47] <sandeepk> .py is text file
[16:27:51] <sandeepk> kushal: ^^
[16:27:51] <moizsajid> .exe is binary
[16:27:51] <LambaInsaan> .pyc is binary I guess.
[16:27:58] <kushal> Ye
[16:28:00] <kushal> yes.
[16:28:28] <madhurii> py is scripting file format
[16:28:38] <kushal> madhurii, text or binary?
[16:28:49] <madhurii> binary
[16:28:59] <mbtamuli12_> .py is text
[16:29:07] <mbtamuli12_> As shown by the file command.
[16:29:10] <mbtamuli12_> ASCII text.
[16:29:14] <kushal> mbtamuli12_, :)
[16:29:18] <mbtamuli12_> Correct me if I am wrong?
[16:29:27] <vharsh> .docx is a kind of archive file
[16:29:27] <kushal> mbtamuli12_, Can you please explain that command to others here?
[16:29:51] <madhurii> kushal,correct me also if am wrong?
[16:29:54] <mbtamuli12_> file command is used to determine the file type.
[16:29:57] <mbtamuli12_> file <
[16:30:14] <mbtamuli12_> file <filename> will display the type of a file
[16:30:15] <kushal> madhurii, try file somefile.py
[16:30:50] <kushal> https://shellshare.net/r/summertraining
[16:32:26] <kushal> Is that okay for everyone?
[16:32:35] <kushal> If you have question, feel free to type !
[16:33:36] <tasin> What is all that code on shellshare?
[16:34:23] <abhishekg5> tasin: That's kushal  sharing his terminal
[16:34:29] <kushal> tasin, it is not code, it is the output of the file command
[16:34:45] <tasin> ok got it
[16:36:10] <kushal> Now first tip:
[16:36:11] <SpEcHiDe> roll call: Shrimadhav U K [sorry I am late]
[16:36:28] <akash99> Roll Call : Akash Ganbote
[16:36:31] <mpmaurya> Mudit Maurya
[16:41:10] <SRvSaha> Roll Call : Saurav Saha
[16:41:23] <SRvSaha> Sorry for being late. Was busy in playing Badminton
[16:42:56] <SRvSaha> Is the session going on ??
[16:43:18] <lambainsaan_> SRvSaha, yes.
[16:44:19] <kushal> sorry got disconnected
[16:44:21] <kushal> What was the last line from me?
[16:44:37] <avik> <kushal> Now first tip:
[16:44:57] <kushal> If you open a file, remember to close it.
[16:44:59] <kushal> In any programming language, in any OS
[16:45:07] <kushal> Always remember to close the open files.
[16:46:27] * kushal is having huge network lags
[16:47:11] <kushal> In Python we use open call to open a file handler.
[16:47:29] <kushal> please follow https://shellshare.net/r/summertraining
[16:49:53] <hydro> anushil kumar
[16:52:57] <kushal> So the easy way: Open a file, read all the lines, and then close it.
[16:53:42] <kushal> If you want read the whole file at once (bad idea for big files), you can use the read method.
[16:53:47] <kushal> fobj.read()
[16:53:59] <kushal> Now python has a better way to do this.
[16:54:43] <kushal> Where we do not have to manually close the file.
[16:54:49] <kushal> Let us go back to the shell
[16:55:52] <kushal> You can see, I never closed the file manually
[16:56:19] <kushal> with statement makes sure that the opened file is closed at the end.
[16:57:12] <kushal> Any questions till now?
[16:57:24] <kushal> Always try to use the with statements.
[16:57:53] <abstatic> !
[16:58:17] <kushal> next
[16:58:19] <kushal> next
[16:58:20] <abstatic> but what if we want to use the file again in later part of program ? Will we have to reopen it ?
[16:58:28] <kushal> abstatic, Yes.
[16:58:31] <hydro> yes
[16:58:41] <abstatic> Okay
[16:58:58] <kushal> Question is why do need to read it again?
[16:59:07] <kushal> You can read once, store it in a variable
[16:59:15] <kushal> and use that variable as many times as you want.
[16:59:29] <kushal> Unless you know that the file content is changed in between.
[17:00:14] <kushal> Any other question?
[17:00:21] <abstatic> Thanks kushal
[17:01:10] <kushal> To write to a file, you will have to open it in write mode.
[17:01:17] <kushal> open("filepath", "w")
[17:01:39] <kushal> that w stands for write mode
[17:02:24] <kushal> We actually open in read mode when we do open("filepath", "r")
[17:02:52] <kushal> But that r is the default value, means if you do not provide it, then it will open in read mode.
[17:04:08] <kushal> Is this okay?
[17:04:32] <code_geek> yes
[17:04:34] <abstatic> Yes
[17:04:38] <sandeepk> yes
[17:04:38] <Anupama> yup
[17:04:54] <aman_> yes
[17:05:29] <poonam>  !
[17:05:30] <hydro> yep
[17:05:31] <deep123k> Yes
[17:05:34] <kushal> next
[17:06:46] <poonam> w used to append the , is there any option to overwrite the file?
[17:07:07] <code_geek> w is for overwriting
[17:07:39] <poonam> okay then what is for appending?
[17:07:41] <code_geek> for append we use "a"
[17:07:45] <kushal> w is for writing, does not matter if it is a new file, or old file (which will be overridden)
[17:08:02] <poonam> okay
[17:12:33] <kushal>  less /proc/meminfo
[17:12:41] <kushal> See the contents of that file.
[17:13:04] <kushal> First 3 lines show total, free and available memory in your computer.
[17:13:17] <kushal> Now try to write a code, myfree.py
[17:13:26] <kushal> which will show those 3 values in MB.
[17:13:41] <kushal> remember to write proper functions, and call them
[17:13:49] <mbtamuli12_> !
[17:14:55] <kushal> next
[17:15:00] <mbtamuli12_> Does free -m show the same information as the information in /proc/meminfo
[17:15:19] <mbtamuli12_> Does it actually read from /proc/meminfo?
[17:15:25] <kushal> mbtamuli12_, I guess so :)
[17:15:44] <kushal> Not sure how it is implemented, but the same information.
[17:24:02] <mbtamuli12_> http://sprunge.us/GbZa?py
[17:25:44] * mbtamuli12_ going for dinner. Be back later. Sorry.
[17:25:55] <kushal> mbtamuli12_, which one is what?
[17:25:58] <kushal> :)
[17:26:12] <code_geek> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/409247/
[17:26:25] <kushal> Finish this off, show us the answer tomorrow
[17:26:52] <kushal> code_geek, show us what is what :)
