[15:07:08] <sandeepmaity09> Sorry I'm late, Roll Call: Sandeep Maity
[15:07:32] <kushal> Okay.
[15:07:44] <kushal> So for the people who already know Python or parts of Python
[15:07:54] <kushal> The programming sessions may look a bit slow at first/
[15:08:01] <kushal> Because we will go slow.
[15:08:22] <kushal> We will give enough time for everyone to practice.
[15:08:38] <vharsh> kushal, We might pick up something new in the way :)
[15:09:18] <buvanesh_kumar> I am new
[15:09:22] <vharsh> kushal, most of us are new :)
[15:09:27] <buvanesh_kumar> roll call: Buvanesh kumar
[15:09:33] <rohit_> iam also new
[15:09:45] <akhilesh> i am new
[15:09:50] <ananthakrishnan> roll call:ananthakrishnan
[15:10:33] <rahuldecoded> i am new
[15:11:08] <rohit_> roll call:Rohit jaysankar
[15:12:38] <meamitk> i am
[15:14:01] <kushal> Okay
[15:14:29] <kushal> I was taking time to check the setup once more.
[15:14:30] <kushal> Now.
[15:14:47] <kushal> So we will start with Python today
[15:14:52] <kushal> I will do demo on shellshare
[15:14:54] <acetakwas> Roll call: Tosin Animashaun
[15:15:06] <kushal> and we will discus or take questions here.
[15:15:15] <shauryak_3> Roll call : Shaurya Kalia
[15:15:22] <goutham__> discuss
[15:15:23] <kushal> Python is a dynamic and interpreted language.
[15:15:38] <kushal> goutham__, thanks
[15:15:50] <kushal> Means we can simply type the code in an interpreter.
[15:16:01] <kushal> Which is python3 in our case.
[15:16:07] <kushal> https://shellshare.net/r/summertraining
[15:16:12] <kushal> I will type there
[15:16:19] <kushal> and I will come here
[15:16:56] <code_geek_> Roll Call: Shantanu Acharya
[15:17:22] <amey> Roll call:Amey Jain
[15:17:28] <code_geek_> Sorry, I am late. I just came back from college, can someone catch me up?
[15:17:38] <kushal> code_geek_, https://shellshare.net/r/summertraining
[15:17:49] <code_geek_> okay, kushal
[15:17:56] <kushal> >>> in the line means the interpreter is waiting for the next input
[15:18:54] <kushal> That was a typo :(
[15:19:00] <kushal> When I wrote a = 1
[15:19:35] <iyogeshjoshi> roll call:Yogesh
[15:19:44] <kushal> python created a variable a (though in details it works little bit differently) and store 1 in it.
[15:20:02] <kushal> So now a is 20
[15:20:16] <kushal> Now is a is 25
[15:20:19] <jargonmonk> Roll call : Aniket
[15:20:27] <kushal> We can actually print this on the screen
[15:20:52] <kushal> Here print() is a function all, a is the function argument.
[15:21:21] <kushal> I hope this is okay
[15:21:37] <akahat> Roll call : Amol Kahat
[15:21:48] <moizsajid> yes
[15:21:51] <Krishna> kushal: yes
[15:21:58] <akshays> yes
[15:21:58] <Madhumathi> yes
[15:22:06] <kushal> * is for multiplication
[15:22:10] <pabitrapati> Roll Call - Pabitra Pati
[15:22:10] <akhilesh> yes
[15:22:12] <chaitanya> yes
[15:22:24] <kushal>  / for division
[15:22:33] <kushal> Is this okay?
[15:22:41] <kushal> Don't answer
[15:22:43] <kushal> wait
[15:22:45] <kushal> :)
[15:22:52] <aman_> Okay
[15:23:01] <gobinda_> ok
[15:23:16] <kushal> Now you can you find the answer if you multiply 324532532453245234532432453237 with 789
[15:23:25] <kushal> try it out.
[15:23:34] <kushal> If you have a problem, then type ! here
[15:24:00] <madhurii> Okay
[15:24:05] <akshays> 256056168105610490046089205603993
[15:24:20] <kushal> akshays, you don't have to give us the answer.
[15:24:22] <pabitra> can anybody please pm me what i missed
[15:24:30] <akshays> ohh sorry !
[15:24:59] <pksadiq> /msg pabitra <kushal> Now you can you find the answer if you multiply
[15:24:59] <pksadiq>          324532532453245234532432453237 with 789
[15:25:05] <kushal> pksadiq, ?
[15:25:10] <pksadiq> oops. sorry
[15:25:14] <kushal> pksadiq, also /query first
[15:25:15] <kushal> :)
[15:25:24] <abstatic> !
[15:25:26] <kushal> next
[15:25:38] <abstatic> what if we want to do integer division ? (i am new to python 3)
[15:25:54] <kushal> abstatic, convert the answer to int
[15:26:08] <abstatic> kushal, okay.
[15:26:15] <kushal> For everyone else: if you see closely 30 / 2 returns 15.0
[15:26:17] <rohan_h> abstatic, If you want to truncate decimal, use //
[15:26:31] <anushil051> .
[15:26:32] <kalyan> what if want answer to be in float?
[15:26:33] <abhishekg5> roll call: Abhishek Gupta
[15:26:50] <kushal> rohan_h, that is floor division
[15:27:00] <avik> !
[15:27:01] <kushal> now the numbers with a . in it are known as floats
[15:27:02] <kushal> like
[15:27:04] <kushal> 1.0
[15:27:09] <kushal> 1.3245
[15:27:12] <kushal> 56.7
[15:27:14] <goutham__> if i divide any two numbers,can i have a chance to get the result in reduced fraction form?
[15:27:16] <kushal> 8.0
[15:27:18] <rohan_h> kushal, okay :)
[15:27:33] <kushal> next
[15:27:53] <avik> do we not have to give the datatypes with variables? eg. int a=1 ?
[15:28:09] <rahuldecoded> avik no
[15:28:17] <kushal> For some strange reason pabitrapati gave a roll call in the Fedora Cloud channel.
[15:28:29] <kushal> avik, No, as it is a dynamic language, we don't have to.
[15:28:45] <kushal> Check the shellshare
[15:29:03] <kushal> a was integer first
[15:29:07] <kushal> and became float
[15:29:25] <kushal> we can find the type of a variable by using type function
[15:29:44] <moizsajid> The type() function might be helpful for this
[15:29:54] <avik> got it :)
[15:30:32] <chshbh> avik, its like the variable is a name binding the value and it automatically casts the type unto itslef as per the value
[15:30:38] <moizsajid> kushal: Ignore what I said
[15:30:42] <amey> !
[15:30:44] <kushal> next
[15:31:17] <amey> Does it makes difference that type(a) command gives type 'int' rather than class 'int'
[15:31:19] <amey> ?
[15:31:58] <rahuldecoded> !
[15:31:59] <rahuldecoded> !!
[15:32:25] <kushal> amey, In Python3 it will tell you class
[15:32:46] <avik> !
[15:32:51] <kushal> amey, does it only say int in your case?
[15:32:53] <kushal> next
[15:33:11] <amey> no it says <type 'int'>
[15:33:20] <amey> I am python 2.7
[15:33:34] <amey> Should I download version 3?
[15:33:36] <rahul_bajaj> amey, which distro ?
[15:33:39] <kushal> amey, so you have to use Python3 for this session.
[15:33:41] <rahul_bajaj> amey yes
[15:33:46] <kushal> amey, we discussed this on Monday.
[15:33:50] <kushal> next
[15:33:52] <avik> then how to get the only the int result of 15/2 ?
[15:34:20] <amey> OK, I will ask beforehand from now on. Thanks.
[15:34:31] <deep123k> 15//2 avik
[15:34:37] <rahul_bajaj> avik, type int(15/2)
[15:35:08] <rahul_bajaj> deep123k, that will also do :)
[15:35:49] <sandy_> !
[15:35:49] <iKshitij> !
[15:36:54] <iKshitij> What of we want--- >> a=5  >>b=2  a/b >>2.5
[15:37:06] <iKshitij> of is if
[15:37:14] <kushal> wait everyone.
[15:37:28] <kushal> There is something called, type conversion.
[15:37:36] <kushal> Where we can convert one type to another.
[15:37:41] <kushal> like (look at shellshare)
[15:38:14] <kushal> int() and float()
[15:38:24] <kushal> Now we also have to have to work with text all the time.
[15:38:30] <kushal> We call them strings
[15:38:36] <kushal> type is str
[15:38:48] <kushal> Can be defined inside a '' or ""
[15:38:50] <kushal> like
[15:38:58] <buvanesh_kumar> !
[15:39:26] <kushal> Ooops typing error
[15:39:43] <kushal> You can see I started with ' and when tried to end with " it gave error
[15:39:59] <kushal> next
[15:40:04] <sandy_> what is difference between print(a) and typing a and than pressing enter both shows a's value.
[15:40:17] <sandy_> or they are same
[15:40:31] <buvanesh_kumar> What is the difference between ' ' and " ". I already googled it. But unable to understand.
[15:40:43] <kushal> sandy_, just typing a and pressing enter is only for the interpreter, but for the real program, we will always have to print
[15:40:49] <kushal> sandy_, look closely now
[15:41:04] <kushal> sandy_, can you see the difference?
[15:41:14] <sandy_> in print there is no ''
[15:41:19] <kushal> sandy_, Yes
[15:41:37] <kushal> sandy_, and when I typed name and pressed enter, you can guess the type by seeing those ';
[15:41:40] <kushal> sandy_, and when I typed name and pressed enter, you can guess the type by seeing those ''
[15:41:49] <kushal> buvanesh_kumar, why are you asking in the middle?
[15:42:02] <pabitra> buvanesh_kumar, there is no difference between '' and "". they are used to represent a string in python.
[15:42:09] <pabitra> you can use any of them
[15:42:34] <kushal> next
[15:42:38] <sandy_> kushal: got it, thank's :-)
[15:42:56] <kushal> pabitra, please do not answer people who are asking out of turn.
[15:42:58] <kushal> next
[15:43:04] <kushal> buvanesh_kumar, this is your turn.
[15:43:05] <pabitra> oh okay.
[15:43:26] <buvanesh_kumar> Got answer :). actually i typed it and get my question ready , i am planned to enter it when my role come, but typo error. pressed Enter
[15:43:35] <buvanesh_kumar> Thanks kushal :)
[15:43:52] <kushal> buvanesh_kumar, Okay
[15:43:54] <kushal> next
[15:44:00] <buvanesh_kumar> +1 kushal pabitra
[15:44:17] <kushal> We can also do like
[15:44:21] <kushal> (watch shellshare)
[15:44:24] <manoj_> can u say how to use "IF-ELSE" in python
[15:44:57] <kushal> manoj_, no
[15:44:59] <chshbh> manoj_, https://shellshare.net/r/summertraining
[15:46:44] <kushal> I hope this is okay.
[15:47:08] <madhurii> kushal, yes
[15:47:50] <manoj_> yes
[15:47:58] <manoj_> thank uu
[15:48:10] <kushal> manoj_, the spelling is you.
[15:48:10] <venki> !
[15:48:14] <kushal> next
[15:48:50] <venki> is there loops such as for,while in python
[15:49:04] <avik> venki, yes
[15:49:28] <venki> is it similar to c
[15:50:02] <avik> syntax is different. theory is same
[15:50:17] <venki> ok got it!!
[15:50:20] <kushal> venki, are you new in this session?
[15:50:27] <meamitk> venki it is better give time to kushal to teach :)
[15:50:27] <goutham__> !
[15:50:30] <kushal> venki, if yes, then we have rules for asking questions.
[15:50:42] <sandeepmaity09> meamitk +1
[15:50:49] <kushal> venki, you type ! (as goutham__ did above) and wait for your turn.
[15:50:58] <kushal> And ask only when batul says so.
[15:51:00] <chandu> is '....' and "......" both are same in string case?
[15:51:17] <kushal> chandu, read the above few lines to venki
[15:51:34] <kushal> So, back to code
[15:51:38] <venki> yes
[15:51:42] <avik> oops, sorry kushal i answered questions, out of turn:(
[15:51:58] <kushal> using relational operators we can write condition statements.
[15:52:04] <kushal> Which can check for a condition.
[15:52:38] <kushal> Let us check if a number is greater than 10 or not
[15:53:16] <kushal> if condition:       <--- remember that colon at the end
[15:53:22] <chandu> !
[15:53:43] <kushal> next line starts with ...  means it is waiting for the rest of the if statement.
[15:53:49] <kushal> I gave 4 spaces.
[15:54:01] <kushal> then I am going to print a line
[15:54:07] sindhu__ is now known as sindhu_
[15:54:20] <manoj_> !
[15:54:34] <kushal> Next line it is still waiting if there are more lines for the if block.
[15:54:40] <kushal> but we don't have any
[15:54:49] <kushal> so we can end the if block and giving a blank line.
[15:55:11] <kushal> and as the condition is true, it printed the statement (line).
[15:55:13] <kushal> next
[15:55:18] <Anupama> !
[15:55:26] <goutham__> can we change the font of text in strings
[15:55:46] <kiran_> !
[15:55:50] <kushal> goutham__, yes, just change the font of the terminal, python does not know what font you are using.
[15:55:52] <kushal> next
[15:55:58] <chandu> is '....' and "......" both are same in string case?
[15:56:07] <kushal> chandu, yes, they are same
[15:56:14] <kushal> chandu, look at the shellshare
[15:56:21] <chandu> ok thank you
[15:56:49] <kiran_> print(result
[15:56:58] <kushal> next
[15:57:08] <kushal> kiran_, type in the terminal not on IRC :)
[15:57:19] <manoj_> what is the use "white spaces" in python,i could not under stand that
[15:58:12] <kushal> manoj_, very good question.
[15:58:25] <kushal> manish, whitespaces are used for indentation.
[15:58:33] <kushal> by using those, we mark blocks of code.
[15:58:43] <mounica> !
[15:58:59] <iKshitij> !
[15:59:04] <kushal> like in that if statement, all the lines to be executed when the statement is true, has to be properly indented with 4 spaces.
[15:59:11] <kushal> look at the shellshare
[15:59:36] <kushal> as I started randomly after giving one space, it is giving me error.
[15:59:37] <kushal> next
[15:59:41] <Anupama> The indentation acts as block?
[15:59:46] <mounica> can we use more than one statement in if condition?
[15:59:48] <Anupama> ^ this was the question. cleared
[15:59:48] <kushal> Anupama, yes.
[15:59:56] <kushal> mounica, yes, I will do that now
[16:01:15] <kushal> see, none of it worked as a is not greater than b
[16:01:43] <kushal> ah, a is a string now
[16:01:44] <kushal> :(
[16:01:55] <lambainsaan> !
[16:02:28] <kushal> worked

[16:19:16] <kushal> pksadiq, problem is, I can not find the server I was using before :(
