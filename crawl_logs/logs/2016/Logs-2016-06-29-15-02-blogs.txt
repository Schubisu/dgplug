[15:34:18] <kushal> Now this is very important in Open Source world.
[15:34:22] <iKshitij> !
[15:34:28] <kushal> As people can read about what you are working on.
[15:34:44] <kushal> They will know about your interests, and other random things.
[15:34:57] <kushal> It can be fully technical or personal, or mix of both.
[15:34:59] <kushal> next
[15:35:06] <pabitrapati> kushal, I am in process of creating one... :D
[15:35:39] <kushal> People who do not have a blog, you can go to https://wordpress.com/
[15:35:43] <kushal> and create a blog there.
[15:35:54] <kushal> Remember to give a nice name for the blog,
[15:36:21] <sayan> yes, it's a tag you will carry for your life :) Give it a good name

[15:37:26] <pabitrapati> kushal, I was trying but all the blogs are listing one below the other in wordpress. where as is it possible to list them page by page ??
[15:37:35] <kushal> pabitrapati, ?

[16:01:29] <kushal> avik, ?
[16:01:30] <thisisashwani> because it seems quite confusing, different licenses!
[16:01:38] <avik> i do not know muchyes kushal!
[16:01:47] <avik> oops
[16:01:59] <avik> yes kushal
[16:02:13] <avik> but its nothing much to share
[16:02:54] <avik> and sorry for the late answer :/
[16:03:11] <kushal> avik, Do you think all the things you know, any of your friends know?
[16:03:25] <kushal> avik, Do you think that it is too less for them to learn?
[16:03:32] <kushal> Nothing is small.
[16:03:41] <avik> ok i give up
[16:03:45] <kushal> ?
[16:03:53] <kushal> For example, some math problem may be very easy for you.
[16:04:29] <avik> lets see if i can help others
[16:04:34] <kushal> But for sure it is very difficult for me.
[16:04:44] <chshbh> okay, done.
[16:05:00] <tgadsing_> Done.
[16:05:05] <sayan> avik: I was going through abstatic blog post and saw this post - http://abstatic.github.io/dotfiles.html
[16:05:16] <priyanka> i have created it, thanks kushal for waiting.
[16:05:21] <kushal> avik, You don't worry about that, just write regular blog posts.
[16:05:33] <abhishekg5> avik, take it slow. We start small. Always. Everyone. You can blog about vim, fhs, reST, sphinx. See, plenty of things. And a lot more to come
[16:05:57] <sayan> the topic is dotfiles. something which I know but you might not know so you will be interested in reading
[16:06:13] <avik> :)
[16:06:49] <kushal> abstatic, nice, keep writing like this.
[16:07:03] <kushal> Write regularly.
[16:07:11] <kushal> It takes years to become good at it.
[16:07:14] <abstatic> sayan, and that reminds me, that I have to do another blog post which will cover the uploaded dotfiles. That post is half complete.
[16:07:19] * kushal is still not good at all. 
[16:07:33] <abstatic> kushal, thank you kushal ! , means a lot
[16:07:34] <himanshutechy> :)
[16:07:54] <ak_d> kushal: my internet is not working smoothly right now, I'm not able to make blog at the moment.
[16:08:13] <ak_d> I'll do it later
[16:08:23] pksadiq` is now known as pksadiq
[16:08:30] <kushal> ak_d, okay
[16:08:37] <kushal> One thing for tonight, everyone write a blog post about this summer training, all good/bad things you want to share.
[16:09:08] <aman_> Yes, i will .Thanks kushal :)
[16:09:15] <kushal> I will start a thread in the list, reply to it (inline reply) with the link to your blog.
[16:09:46] <himanshutechy> yes Sergeant
[16:10:00] <kushal> next
[16:10:09] <moizsajid_> Why are software packages like Nikola called static site generators even though we continuously add blog posts from time to time?
[16:10:40] <kushal> moizsajid_, because you are writing a static file on your computer, and then generating the html files from it.
[16:11:21] <kushal> those html files are static, nothing is happening on the server to generate those.
[16:11:30] <kushal> The server just servers those as it is.
[16:11:38] <kushal> Means they are faster.
[16:12:03] <code_geek_> kushal: My internet connection is not working properly. I'll create a blog later.
[16:12:09] <sayan> moizsajid_: you might want to read the difference between static web pages and dynamic web pages
[16:12:30] <moizsajid_> okay
[16:12:34] <kushal> code_geek_, Okay
[16:12:37] <sayan> next
[16:12:58] <kushal> avik, has a question.
[16:13:10] <kushal> avik, ask here.
[16:13:25] <avik> what is the meaning :
[16:13:35] <avik>  "I will start a thread in the list, reply to it (inline reply) with the link to your blog."
[16:13:39] <rahul_bajaj> !
[16:13:44] <kushal> Who wants to answer avik ?
[16:13:50] <kushal> Go ahead and answer
[16:14:16] <kushal> avik, Let us see if anyone from here wants to help you or not :)
[16:14:27] <kushal> avik, It is a valid question.
[16:14:32] <priyanka> actually, i have the same dout as avik
[16:14:35] <thisisashwani> avik, that means you will get a mail tonight
[16:14:40] <snarwade> avik, kushal will send a mail to mailing list
[16:14:41] <rohan_h> avik, He was talking about the mailing list. There you will reply inline with a link to your blog.
[16:14:46] <thisisashwani> reply to that mail with your blog post link
[16:14:52] <abstatic> It means that kushal will send out a new mail in the mailing list, in reply to which we will write the link to the blog post that we have written. "inline reply" means that we will trim the content and add our reply
[16:15:00] <vharsh> avik, You can reply in three ways, inline, top-posting, bottom-posting.
[16:15:08] <snarwade> so you have to put your blog link in inline reply
[16:15:28] <thisisashwani> avik: so many people are here to help you! :D
[16:15:33] <kushal> :)
[16:15:37] <vharsh> top-posting is discouraged, as it is equivalent to writing the question before the answer.
[16:15:39] <kushal> I just found https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/MailingListEtiquette
[16:15:45] <moizsajid_> kushal will start an email thread for us to show our work i.e. the link to out blog, remember the initial thread before dgplug started?
[16:15:47] <vharsh> kushal, Community power :)
[16:15:48] <avik> is inline == normal reply?
[16:15:58] <kushal> avik, In our community, yes
[16:16:05] <kushal> avik, most of the devels do that.
[16:16:45] <avik> devels ==?
[16:17:00] <dep1> developer i guess
[16:17:03] <kushal> developers
[16:17:10] <vharsh> oops, it is "writing the answer before the question."
[16:17:28] <kushal> vharsh, hehe :)
[16:17:35] <avik> ok. sorry
[16:17:49] * vharsh should have used the s/ notation here.
[16:17:50] <rohan_h> avik, why sorry?
[16:18:35] <avik> sorry for the stupid question! not a Smart one :p
[16:18:46] <kushal> avik, stupid questions are also okay.
[16:18:56] <kushal> avik, but ask those to google.com first :)
[16:18:56] <avik> hehe.
[16:19:09] <code_geek_> Has anyone created a blog right now? Give me the link. I want to see.
[16:19:41] <anushil051> code_geek code_geek_

[16:20:42] <rahul_bajaj> by using a static blog generator, can we have sessions and interconnections between links?

[16:21:02] <vharsh> https://vharshblog.wordpress.com/

[16:22:56] <kushal> Not sure why people are sharing here.
[16:23:00] <kushal> We never asked for that.
[16:23:08] <anushil051> code_geek_, https://anushil05.wordpress.com/2016/06/29/oneplus-3/
[16:23:12] <kushal> People just do forget that the session is going on.
[16:23:14] <kushal> :(
[16:23:35] <moizsajid_> code_geek, asked for our blog links
[16:23:42] <thisisashwani> kushal: actually someone asked for that, and everyone jumped on the boat.
[16:23:44] <D1mz> kushal, code_geek asked
[16:23:54] <D1mz> :)
[16:23:55] <code_geek_> sorry kushal :(
[16:24:05] <kushal> moizsajid_, D1mz He can ask 1 million dollar too, will you give that to him?
[16:24:17] <himanshutechy> apology ;(
[16:24:42] <avik> sorry :(
[16:24:52] <rahul_bajaj> sayan, like on wordpress at the end of one blog, we get the option to look at the previous and next blog
[16:24:53] <kushal> Anyway
[16:25:06] <kushal> rahul_bajaj, Yes
[16:25:08] <D1mz> I'm sorry:( I should have sent him privately
[16:25:11] <kushal> that depends on theme
[16:25:26] <rahul_bajaj> kushal, okay.

[16:26:29] amrtanair_ is now known as amrtanair
[16:26:57] <kushal> Okay
[16:27:44] <kushal> There is a software called planet, we use that to aggravate many blogs into a single place.
[16:27:54] <kushal> (There are other software too).
[16:28:09] <kushal> For example: in Fedora we have http://fedoraplanet.org/
[16:28:23] <kushal> From dgplug we have http://planet.dgplug.org
[16:28:57] <kushal> People follow these planets regularly, so when your blog gets added to any planet, all the people who follows that planet, will read your blog posts.
[16:29:08] <kushal> That is a super useful way to reach to many people.
[16:31:06] <D1mz> !
[16:31:18] <kushal> next
[16:31:32] <D1mz> kushal, Is it okay to add my blog to a planet if I use the blog as my personal blog also?
[16:31:59] <kushal> D1mz, yes, that case you can say which all tags/categories will go to the planet.
[16:32:15] <kushal> Like I have a special feed for Python planet, all posts with Python tag
[16:32:25] <kushal> for Fedora or dgplug I just link to my whole blog
[16:32:47] <D1mz> How can i add my blog to a planet?
[16:33:20] <kushal> D1mz, every project(planet) has a different rules.
[16:33:27] <jogi96_> Kushal, how can i add my blog to planet?
[16:33:30] <kushal> D1mz, For dgplug, we want to add only regular member
[16:33:34] <kushal> D1mz, For dgplug, we want to add only regular member's blogs
[16:33:51] <kushal> jogi96_, see above.
[16:33:57] <priyanka> I am new to the blog, i mean that i don't know what to write about, any suggestions?
[16:33:57] <kushal> So for tonight, your job is to write at least one blog post, and share the link to the blog (not the post, but the link to the blog itself).
[16:34:15] <kushal> priyanka, Write about the summer training, what you liked, what you hated?
[16:34:15] <jogi96_> Yeah got the answer kushal
[16:34:16] <D1mz> I mean the procedure for adding
[16:34:20] <kushal> How did you find about it.
[16:34:22] <kushal> etc
[16:34:26] <akorep> !
[16:34:28] <kushal> D1mz, it depends.
[16:34:34] <kushal> next
[16:34:34] <priyanka> okay, thank you kushal.
[16:35:01] <D1mz> thank you
[16:35:16] <akorep> Can I write about anything else other than the summer training?
[16:35:26] <code_geek_> !
[16:35:26] <sayan> akorep: yes
[16:35:31] <sayan> next
[16:35:34] <code_geek_> Instead of using the free domain name from wordpress, can I buy a domain name from another website (for example: from godaddy) and then link that to my wordpress blog?
[16:35:44] <jogi96_> Kushal: can we add our old blogs the we have written or we have to start new?
[16:36:11] <kushal> jogi96_, you can not add, only the person/group runs the planet can add.
[16:36:26] <sayan> code_geek_: you can buy and do that
[16:36:27] <kushal> code_geek_, don't use godaddy.
