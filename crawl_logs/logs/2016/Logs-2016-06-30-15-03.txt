[15:13:59] <priyanka_> Thanks code_geek.
[15:14:02] <vharsh> !
[15:14:05] <thisisashwani> !
[15:14:16] <moizsajid> What to do if Gmail auto hides the previous message using three dots?
[15:14:42] <moizsajid> or ellipses?
[15:14:43] <buvanesh_kumar> you can possibly expand it. moizsajid ;)
[15:14:44] <code_geek> click those three dots and it will show previous messages
[15:14:52] <kushal> moizsajid, ^^^
[15:15:12] <kushal> also for gmail, in the right bottom, there is an option to reply in plain text
[15:15:14] <kushal> Please do that.
[15:15:22] <kushal> Set that as default option.
[15:15:23] <kushal> next
[15:15:26] <vharsh> Did you explicitly write this line? "On 29/06/16, Kushal Das wrote: "
[15:15:31] <akshays> !
[15:15:40] <SRvSaha> !
[15:15:45] <kushal> vharsh, Nope, my mail client did it, gmail does the same iirc
[15:15:46] <kushal> next
[15:15:50] <vharsh> Or did gmail, mailer wrote this for you  <EOF>
[15:15:54] <tgadsing_> Sorry for joining late.
[15:15:59] <abhishekg5> !
[15:16:03] <thisisashwani> ksuhal: how did you open the mail in vim? :D
[15:16:03] <kushal> tgadsing_, no problem
[15:16:12] <thisisashwani> My mistake, I will find it myself from google! :)
[15:16:23] <kushal> thisisashwani, I write my emails in vim, I will show how in some other day
[15:16:25] <kushal> next
[15:16:50] <kushal> next
[15:16:50] <mhalano> !
[15:16:50] <akshays> i had the same question
[15:17:01] <SRvSaha> Is there any difference between Inline reply and bottom reply ? Actually the way you have shown your bottom reply using inline mode in Gmail.
[15:17:17] <thisisashwani> kushal: okay, so can you see all the mails you get in vim too?
[15:17:51] <shobhitaqua14> !
[15:17:51] <kushal> SRvSaha, They are almost same, but for inline I can have more paragraphs of the original thread after my reply, and then my comments there too
[15:17:58] <kushal> SRvSaha, read the doc from mbuf.
[15:18:06] <kushal> thisisashwani, I use mutt, google about it :)
[15:18:08] <kushal> next
[15:18:19] <abhishekg5> kushal, same ques as thisisashwani. solved
[15:18:22] <kushal> next
[15:18:51] <kushal> next
[15:18:53] <shobhitaqua14> what is the means of <,<<,<<< in gmail?
[15:19:13] <kushal> That is marking the depth of the thread
[15:19:16] <kushal> >>>>
[15:19:16] <mbtamuli12> Roll Call: Mriyam Tamuli
[15:19:22] <kushal> next
[15:19:40] <kushal> Now who all think that they replied wrongly in the list?
[15:20:00] <avik> I
[15:20:04] <ak_d> me
[15:20:06] <Anupama> me
[15:20:13] <rahul_bajaj> !
[15:20:21] <kushal> Only 3?
[15:20:24] <kushal> next
[15:20:27] <abstatic> Me - because i did not write my name at the ending, and pasted the direct link instead of doing something like [1]
[15:20:35] <code_geek> I didn't use [1], is that wrong?
[15:20:37] <kushal> abstatic, which is still better :)
[15:20:51] <rahul_bajaj> kushal, on shellshare can you show me where i can write say, regards, rahul_bajaj .
[15:20:57] <akshays> i did the same as abstatic
[15:21:00] <chshbh> me, i did not write my name
[15:21:13] <kushal> rahul_bajaj, where I wrote XYZ
[15:21:18] <deep123k> !
[15:21:20] <yASH> I did not write my name as well sorry
[15:21:43] <kushal> code_geek, not totally wrong, but that way of writing mails help the people who are reading it.
[15:21:53] <pabitrapati> !
[15:21:57] <kushal> next
[15:22:00] <shobhitaqua14> i write above the question
[15:22:07] <deep123k> Kushal I am still not sure can you check my reply I am sending my email id on pm
[15:22:13] <SRvSaha> I too have not written the name or added signature. Does that matter ?
[15:22:20] <code_geek> Okay kushal , I'll take care of that from next time.
[15:22:30] <kushal> SRvSaha, signature does not, but name yes :)
[15:22:30] <rahul_bajaj> kushal, i should start my answer by saying, regards, Rahul Bajaj, and then answer the question?
[15:22:31] <kushal> next
[15:22:44] <kushal> rahul_bajaj, nah, just read mbuf's documentation
[15:22:44] <pabitrapati> kushal, please refer https://snag.gy/9t5s3D.jpg
[15:23:01] <rahul_bajaj> kushal, ohkay.
[15:23:02] <pabitrapati> should I reply within that indented block ??
[15:23:14] <kushal> pabitrapati, Yes, but first press enter twice
[15:23:21] <kushal> That will break that line in the left
[15:23:39] <kushal> and also click on the plain text mail in the right bottom
[15:23:47] <kushal> next
[15:23:55] <moizsajid> !
[15:24:26] <pabitrapati> !
[15:25:53] <kushal> next
[15:26:11] <moizsajid> If we could remove the previous replies, and then write our message. Is that a good idea?
[15:26:34] <rohan_h> !
[15:26:59] <kushal> moizsajid, sometimes yes
[15:27:19] <akshays> in this case ?
[15:27:27] <akshays> because i did so
[15:27:51] <moizsajid> !
[15:28:19] <kushal> akshays, ?
[15:28:21] <kushal> next
[15:28:28] <pabitrapati> so is it necessary to reply in plain-text mode or we can do just inline as i shown ???
[15:29:04] <akshays> kushal, i mean in the you send us
[15:30:08] <avik> !
[15:30:38] <kushal> pabitrapati, Please read the doc written by mbuf.

[15:32:02] <akshays> got it next time will write it perfectly :)
[15:32:05] <rohan_h> doubt cleared :)
[15:32:07] <kushal> next
[15:32:09] <moizsajid> Are these email etiquettes only applicable for open source world or for all professional matters?
[15:32:21] <kushal> moizsajid, We use the same everywhere.
[15:32:27] <kushal> next
[15:32:32] <avik> i never got any mail from you, only other users replies!
[15:32:55] <avik> what should i have done?
[15:33:11] <SpEcHiDe> avik: did you check your spam folder?
[15:33:27] <abstatic> avik, its maybe because you were added later on to the mailing list.
[15:33:38] <abhishekg5> avik, kushal put you in list after the mail
[15:33:55] <avik> in my win10 mail i do not have spam folder SpEcHiDe

[15:45:32] <joyita_c> hi
[15:45:43] <joyita_c> !
[15:46:33] <rohan_h> !
[15:46:40] <kushal> next
[15:47:53] <joyita_c> I have today first joined the class. Please guide me. What we are learning in this training?
[15:48:18] <vharsh> dgplug.org/irclogs/2016
[15:48:43] <joyita_c> I have vm ware with nano editor but I don't know much about python.
[15:48:45] <vharsh> We have recently created a blog in Wordpress.
[15:49:00] <kushal> joyita_c, we are yet to start learning python
[15:49:05] <vharsh> Read http://blog.rackspace.com/why-technical-people-should-blog-but-dont/
[15:49:09] <kushal> joyita_c, go through the logs
[15:49:34] <joyita_c> okay thank you.
[15:49:39] <akorep> Finished reading.
[15:50:27] <kushal> akorep, any comments?
[15:50:53] <abhishekcs10_> \\\\\]]'
[15:51:01] <kushal> abhishekcs10_, ?
[15:51:08] <SpEcHiDe> Finished reading.
[15:51:12] <himanshutechy> finished
[15:51:27] <jogi96_> !
[15:51:27] <deep123k> Nice motivation
[15:51:30] <kushal> Any comments on that post ?
[15:51:33] <abhishekcs10_> sorry kushal
[15:51:35] <kushal> Just say what ever you want to.
[15:51:47] <akorep> kushal, Well, if you're thinking it inspires me to write blogs, I'm sorry but it doesn't. Close though.
[15:52:07] <akorep> Sorry if I'm being too honest here.
[15:52:18] <kushal> akorep, okay, why don't you want to write blog posts?
[15:52:22] <chshbh> kushal, since we dont have any obsolete guidance in open source, blogging is considered as sharing the experience which can be used by others. correct me if i am wrong.
[15:52:35] <himanshutechy> you have to write what you think even if you don't think it is going to work in readers or you don't know anyting about
[15:52:35] <kushal> chshbh, yes, and you will learn with time.
[15:52:43] <abhishekg5> kushal, I went so involved in it while reading, for a time I forgot there is a session going on :D Really good
[15:53:40] <avik> i liked blog writing from the very first moment. since i dont know much i wrote what my knowledge could compile!
[15:53:41] <jogi96_> Kushal: what are archaic commands?
[15:53:42] <chshbh> kushal, still it requires lots of time. Grammar check, research, i dont know its like you need to give around 4-5 hours per blog, even more.
[15:54:12] <avik> this blog kind of a enhanced it!
[15:54:18] <kushal> chshbh, it depends, sometimes I write in few minutes, most of the time few hours.
[15:54:25] <kushal> next
[15:54:27] <akorep> kushal, I feel whatever I write may not always be on a technical point of view. My biased opinions on my blog could either lead to spreading false knowledge or inciting anger in people.
[15:54:28] <kushal> next
[15:54:29] <rohan_h> kushal,  Should technical and personal blogs be separate?
[15:54:30] <avik> good one kushal ,thank you
[15:54:48] <jogi96_> : Kushal: what are archaic commands?
[15:55:05] <kushal> akorep, that case always mention on the top that this is what you think, this may not be right or others may think different.
[15:55:15] <kushal> rohan_h, I have only one blog
[15:55:19] <kushal> can be different
[15:55:20] <aman_> nice post, my writing, is my voice :)
[15:55:21] <kushal> can be same
[15:55:42] <rohan_h> Okay :)
[15:55:48] <joyita_c> finished reading nice post.
[15:56:18] <sandeepmaity09> This blog really inspires me. I'm trained  in RHCA but never thought that I can write a blog. But after reading this blog i think there are many topics  on which i can write in my blog
[15:56:25] <amitk_> writing is the best way to memorize
[15:56:27] <D1mz> what major said is true because his blog is like a reference and guide to many people like me. Thanks to fedora planet, I found a good blog for people interested in system administration.
[15:56:48] <code_geek> kushal, that was really good. I also thought that I'm not an expert on anything, how can I write. I guess I'll start by sharing my experiences about this training from time to time.
[15:57:08] <code_geek> then write about other stuff
[15:57:15] <abhishekg5> code_geek, yes, indeed
[15:57:24] <code_geek> :)
[15:58:08] <rahuldecoded_> Once I started writing blog when I was in 11th and newly introduced to programming language. I used to blog each and every concept I have read about. But no one there is to encourage me and even my CS faculty told me that I wasting my time there so I stopped writing. This post motivates me once again. :D
[15:58:10] <kushal> jogi96_, even I don't know.
[15:58:37] <jogi96_> Ok kushal :(
[15:58:39] <tgadsing_> kushal,should i start writing blogs about simple technical things that i know?
[15:58:42] <rahul_bajaj> what i feel is when you go for any interview or try to introduce yourself, you cant tell him/her every bits and pieces that you have learned but as well write it in your blog. Secondly, blog writing have increased my communication skills. According to me, blog writing is one of the most important elements of your existence in the open source world.
[15:58:55] <chshbh> jogi96_ google.com
[15:59:05] <rahul_bajaj> akorep, ^^
[15:59:19] <kushal> tgadsing_, yes

[15:59:55] <shalaka> really good.inspiring blog :)
[16:00:00] <abhishekg5> rahuldecoded_, most teachers in schools/colleges do everything but teach
[16:00:33] <kushal> haha
[16:00:36] <code_geek> abhishekg5, +1
[16:01:07] <akshays> like giving assignments and finding ways to screw you even if you are going something good
[16:01:11] <pabitrapati> really nice points rahul_bajaj
[16:01:23] <avik> kushal, can we show our blogs during an interview?
[16:01:25] <rahuldecoded_> abhishekg5 :D
[16:01:36] <sandeepmaity09> :-)
[16:01:45] <avik> does it worth anything?
[16:02:16] <sandeepmaity09> akshays +1
[16:02:17] <shobhitaqua14> can we show our blog writing in resume?
[16:02:24] <rohan_h> avik, Someone may see your blog and give you a interview call :)
[16:02:32] <abhishekcs10_> avik, it can be your portfolio :)
[16:02:49] <avik> :0
[16:03:10] <kushal> avik, it should be part of your resume
[16:03:17] <buvanesh_kumar> I think blogging is the identity for us to this internet world
[16:03:25] <akorep> Besides, if I want to write something, it should be related to what I would like to, which is gaming. Over the years, I have seen that not many people share my passion for game development as I do, not even in FOSS. That makes me feel whether anyone really is interested in what I have to say, and due to personal experiences, I've learned that it is better to remain silent instead of wasting my time doing things no one really cares about.
[16:04:01] <akorep> Sorry if I'm being a little too personal here.
[16:04:38] <priyanka_> after reading the post, i think error in writing don't matter if we are devoted to that. We should keep on learning through our mistakes(errors), important thing is to correct them instead of feeling bad for that.
[16:06:12] <avik> priyanka_, +1
[16:07:02] <kushal> akorep, no problem.
[16:07:08] <rohan_h> akorep, I'm also interested in Game development and know many people from Ubisoft. Just start a blog and write whatever you love, be it gaming or FOSS of FOSS gaming :)
[16:07:10] <kushal> priyanka_, yes
[16:07:19] <akash47> akorep, IMHO the point is to write something 'you' care about. So, if there is someone out there who has the same interests as you, he might learn a thing or two from you.
[16:07:43] <kushal> akorep, btw, there are many foss games.
[16:07:51] <kushal> I play a few of them regularly :)
[16:08:00] <sayan> akorep: The thing is you might not know when someobdy notices you :)
[16:08:02] <rohan_h> kushal, that's what i was saying :D
[16:08:21] <kushal> rohan_h, :)
[16:08:23] <Anandprakash> !
[16:08:27] <yASH> Besides when you're feeling low if you go through your blog (past fun experiences) it can cheer you a lot and reminds who you are and what you've accomplished . Like kushal It really helps you keep track of a lot of things
[16:08:38] <kushal> yASH, Yes :)
[16:08:45] <sandeepmaity09> yASH +1
[16:09:29] <kushal> https://kushaldas.in/posts/my-new-walking-desk.html
[16:09:37] <kushal> :)
[16:09:38] <kushal> yASH, ^^ :)
[16:09:53] <yASH> akorep: I had the same feeling like you. I'm so into game development but I've decided to overcome it and wrote a few on getting started with game development and how fun it is . It really helps
[16:10:06] <abhishekg5> rohan_h, kushal, sugarlabs is one I know but I am unaware about other open source organizations ? You might be knowing ?
[16:10:20] <deep123k> Looks like this chat is more motivating than the blog

[16:15:26] <akorep__> I'd start rambling about my personal life here, but I don't want to disturb the session. Thanks to all who reached out to me. I'll think about writing my blog after all. Don't expect me to be regular though, haha! Takes some time to write what I want to.
[16:16:15] <yASH> Cool that seems to be a nice start. Be open to everything ^^
[16:16:53] <kushal> akorep_, yes, it takes time.
[16:17:20] <yASH> And nice one kushal  impressive. It's like one those life hacks that you can do with things lying around you
