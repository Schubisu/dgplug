   6.
      <debarshi> So today we will look at the basic Unix shell.
   7.
      <debarshi> So all those who are using Unix (or GNU/Linux) right now, do you have your terminals ready?

  22.
      <susenj> !
  23.
      <mobilesuit> ok
  24.
      <debarshi> So what is a shell? Why do we need it at all?
  25.
      <debarshi> Lets try to answer these questions before getting any further.
  26.
      <debarshi> Any guesses from anyone?
  27.
      <TanmayaT> for ease of user to interact with the kernel
  28.
      <kamudhar> The classic textbook answer is "shell is the interface between kernel and userspace programs"
  29.
      <TanmayaT> which in turn interacts with the hardware
  30.
      <t4num0y_cs3> shell is the mediator between user and kernel.
  31.
      <rtnpro> Its an interface between usr and kernel
  32.
      <kushal> TanmayaT, before that type ! , and wait for chance
  33.
      <TanmayaT> !
  34.
      <debarshi> Ok. Ok.
  35.
      * Soumya (n=Soumya@117.192.9.239) has joined #dgplug
  36.
      <susenj> interface between kernel of the OS and user prog+hardware
  37.
      <debarshi> You are more or less right.
  38.
      <kushal> Soumya, tell your full name to all
  39.
      * samar (n=samar-ad@220.226.14.178) has joined #dgplug
  40.
      <debarshi> For those who did not know, a shell is an interface between a human being and the rest of the operating system.
  41.
      <Soumya> Hi this is Soumya Kanti Chakraborty joining in
  42.
      <Soumya> Soory a bit late , was at office
  43.
      <Soumya> hi All
  44.
      <debarshi> So obviously without a shell, the rest of the OS is almost useless.
  45.
      <debarshi> Soumya: Hello
  46.

      <Kishan> kushal, hi kushal...I am Kishan Goyal.
  51.
      <kushal> debarshi, please continue
  52.
      <debarshi> Now the Unix shells are quite sophisticated, in that they can be used in a way similar to a programming language.
  53.
      * mavu (n=satya@59.178.170.223) has joined #dgplug
  54.
      <debarshi> eg., if you want to copy all the MP3s on your system to a CD/DVD quite often,...
  55.
      <debarshi> ... you can combine all the instructions that you would normally give in the form of a 'shell script'.
  56.
      <debarshi> So everytime you invoke the script your CD is ready.
  57.
      <debarshi> Any doubts till now?
  58.
      <susenj> !
  59.
      <debarshi> susenj: ?

<SDey> Debarshi: I am currently using Windows and using Cygwin to run unix environment, can please suggest me how use GCC there??
<mobilesuit_num_2> quit
<debarshi> SDey: No. Use Google.
<SDey> Ok, thanks,I am searching
* samar (n=samar-ad@220.226.50.76) has joined #dgplug
<debarshi> So the most elementary commands are cd, cp, mv, rm, pwd and ls.
<susenj> pls let the study be continued on one topic.Sorry for interruption<EOF>
* partha_ (n=partha@59.93.246.223) has joined #dgplug
<debarshi> Now Unix provides some documentation about every shell command present in the system.
* nandy_lost (n=chatzill@59.178.189.146) has joined #dgplug
<debarshi> The standard way to access the documentation about a particular command is 'man'.
<nandy_lost> sorry 4 being late!
<debarshi> So you type:
<debarshi> $ man ls
<debarshi> <press q> to quit when you are done with the documentation.
<debarshi> 'man' here stands for manual.
<debarshi> You can do:
<debarshi> $ man man
<debarshi> to read the manual of 'man' itself.
<SDey> Yeah, its showing  anme, Synopsis and Description
<debarshi> I want everyone to try 'man'.

<debarshi> Ok. Fine then.
<susenj> tried #man man<EOF>
<SDey> !
<kushal> SDey, yes
<debarshi> SDey: ??
<SDey> What about the -C option
<SDey> ?
<Soumya> !
<debarshi> Many commands have a configuration file...
<debarshi> ...to control their behaviour.
<SDey> !
<kushal> Soumya, yes
<debarshi> 'man' also has a configuration file which mentions where the documentation is stored on the system, how to format the man pages, etc..
<Soumya> debarshi, can you tell me about the man manual sections
<kushal> Soumya, do a $man man
<debarshi> Soumya: Ok.
<Soumya> i did it kushal
<Soumya> from seeing there only i am telling , kushal
<debarshi> Soumya: Ok.

<rishi> Soumya: Did kushal answer your question?
<Soumya> no debarshi
<rishi> So when one does:
<rishi> $ man ls
<susenj> Soumya:#man -k    is it working?
<rishi> ... the man command looks for a man page whos name starts with 'ls'.
<kushal> susenj, please don't interrupt
<rtnpro> !
<rtnpro> what is man -k?
<rishi> Now what happens if there are multiple pages starting with the same string?
<Soumya> susenj, i am answering, let me first hear from debarshi
<rtnpro> <EOF>
<roni> !
* kamudhar has quit ("will join later")
<rishi> In those cases, the pages are divided into sections.
<rishi> Each section is identified by a natural number. eg., 1, 2, etc..
<rishi> For example there are multiple pages having the prefix 'open'.
<rishi> So to see all the pages that are available in all the sections, do:
<rishi> man -a open
<rishi> $ man -a open
<Soumya> let me try rishi
<rishi> Pressing q will take you to the page in the next section.

<Soumya> i also had a question before kushal ?
<Soumya> man -k <command> .. apropos ? , rishi
<roni> $ man ls, when page is opened at top its showing ls(1), what that indicates
<roni> is it the number of pages opened
<rishi> roni: (1) is the section number
* Amit has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
<kamudhar> Debashree: I was offline for a while; messed up irssi config file; so logged in back using chatzilla
<rishi> Soumya: Will come to that.
<Soumya> oks ria
<Soumya> oks rishi
<roni> ok
<Soumya> susenj, man - k is working
<rishi> So lets move to man's cousins.
<susenj> yep ,but it shows a linr only and stops
<susenj> *line
<rtnpro> Soumya, what does man -k does?
<kushal> susenj, rtnpro STOP
<Soumya> do $man - k open
<rishi> rtnpro: Did you look at $ man man ?
<kushal> Soumya, STOP
<Soumya> oks stop
* rishi wants everyone to look up
<roni> rtnpro
<Soumya> rishi, continue sorry for interrupting you
<Soumya> kushal, sorry
<rishi> Now that you know about 'man', it will be assumed that you have looked at the manual (wherever applicable) before asking any question.
<roni> rtnpro, k -  Equivalent to apropos.
* chacha_chaudhry (n=dev@gnu-india/supporter/rakeshpandit) has joined #dgplug
<rishi> So lets move to man's cousins.
<rtnpro> I will look when I log into Linux
<rishi> rtnpro: They are available on the Internet too.
<rtnpro> ok
<rtnpro> I will do a google search <EOF>
* Amit_ has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
<rishi> If you are completely new to Unix, then it is highly unlikely that you will know any command.
<rishi> And if you don't know any command, then you can not use man because you can not tell man which manual to show.
<rishi> Isn't this a common situation for you?
<rishi> This where one can use 'apropos'.
<rishi> So if you want to do something which involves manipulating files, you can do:
<rishi> $ apropos file
<rishi> ... which will search all the manual pages and return those that document commands which manipulate files.
<rishi> Similarly if you want to do something with a directory, you could have done:
<rishi> $ apropos directory

<Soumya_> rishi, i had a power cut
<Soumya_> let me check
<rishi> Soumya_: Can you read the older messages?
<Soumya_> no :(
* SDey has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
* nandy_lost_ has quit ("ChatZilla 0.9.83 [Firefox 1.5.0.12/2007050813]")
<Soumya_> rishi, apropos seems clear
* kushal (n=kd@122.167.37.101) has joined #dgplug
<rishi> The third second cousin is "whatis".
<Soumya_> it mainly searches for all the commands which contains what i give in the apropos
<rishi> Soumya_: Yes.
<rishi> A brief look at 'man whatis' should be enough.
* nandy_lost_ (n=chatzill@59.178.189.146) has joined #dgplug
<rishi> Now if you are using a GNU system (ie. GNU/Linux) you will also have 'info'.
* nandy_lost has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
* nandy_lost_ is now known as nandy_lost
<rishi> Usually the info pages are much more detailed than the man pages, but you might not get an info page for all the commands.
<rishi> 'info' is used in a way similar to man:
<rishi> $ info ls
<susenj> !
<rishi> susenj: Ask.
<susenj> is it just the instruction ,not the whole manual,i saw # info gcc
<susenj> ?<eof>
<rishi> susenj: As I said info pages are very detailed. Almost like a book.
<rishi> So what you see in 'info gcc' is the contents page.
<mobilesuit> !
<rishi> susenj: Take your cursor to a specific topic (marked by *) and hit enter.
<susenj> there is a menu containing features of it
* samar has quit ("Ex-Chat")
<rishi> susenj: Anything more?
<susenj> oh,fine!it was not known to me earlier
<susenj> thnx<eof>
<rishi> mobilesuit: Ask.
<mobilesuit> is info a link between various pages ?
<mobilesuit> <EOF>
<rishi> mobilesuit: No.
<rishi> Info pages are different from man pages.

<kushal> mobilesuit, yes
* Soumya_ is now known as Soumya
<rishi> Info pages are generally generated from Texinfo files. The same Texinfo file which generated an info page can generate a PDF containing the same information.
<rishi> man pages are much smaller and concise and use Troff.
<rishi> Read about Texinfo and Troff if you are interested.
<kushal> To all: If you have any question regarding what the trainer is telling ASK, or else you will only suffer
<kamudhar> rishi: any good resources on Texinfo and Troff

<TanmayaT> i did that, thank you
<rishi> mobilesuit: Ask.
<rishi> arpita: You had a query?
<mobilesuit> i read the man of basename and dirname
<kushal> arpita, Debashree please ask your queries
<mobilesuit> but what is the actual use of these two commands ?
<mobilesuit> <EOF>
<rishi> mobilesuit: Will come to that later.
<kushal> mobilesuit, we will see
<rishi> Ok, we will move on.
* kamudhar has quit ("Will rejoin in a while")
<roni> !
<kushal> roni, ?
<roni> presenly i am unable to get the differences between the two commands
<rishi> roni: Will come to that.
<roni> ok
<rishi> So once you start a shell, you are located within some directory on your system.
<rishi> Usually this will be your home directory, represented as $HOME or ~, but may be some other location too.
<rishi> $ pwd
<rishi> The 'pwd' command is how you find your current location.
<rishi> To change to someother location:
<rishi> $ cd /dir1/dir2/dir3
<rishi> Remember in Unix paths use forward slash ('/') and not backward slash ('\').
<rishi> To return to the location you were in before giving the cd command, do:
<rishi> $ cd -
<rishi> So '-' represents your old working directory.

<mobilesuit> !
<rishi> mobilesuit: Ask.
<mobilesuit> what's the diff betwwen absolute and relative pathname ?
<mobilesuit> <EOF>
<rtnpro> !
<rishi> A pathname which starts with '/' is an absolute path.
<rishi> Absolute paths are always interpreted with respect to the root directory.
<mobilesuit> !
<rishi> Any pathname not starting with '/' is a relative path.
<rishi> They are interpreted with respect to the current working directory, ie. the one shown by pwd.
<mobilesuit> so /home/fre is absolute
<mobilesuit> and when i am in /usr
<rishi> Yes.
* Kishan_ has quit ("Leaving")
<mobilesuit> ../ is relative path ?
<rishi> Yes.
<mobilesuit> like when i am /usr/bin
<mobilesuit> if i want to change to local
<mobilesuit> i write ../local
<mobilesuit> /usr/local
<mobilesuit> sorry
<mobilesuit> i write cd ../local ?
<mobilesuit> <EOF>
<rishi> mobilesuit: Yes. If you have access to a Unix shell, then try it out.
<rishi> mobilesuit: Anything else?
<mavu_> !
<mobilesuit> no..i was just a bit confused
<rishi> rtnpro: Ask.
<mobilesuit> ,EOF>
<rtnpro> I had the same doubt
<rtnpro> about absolute and relative paths
<rishi> Ok,
<rtnpro> It got cleared <EOF>
<rishi> There are a few shortcuts to represent some commnonly used locations in Unix.
<rishi> Some of these are:
<rishi> (i) ~ --> home directory of user that had invoked the shell
<rishi> (ii) ~foo --> fome directory of user 'foo', if user 'foo' has an account on the system
<rishi> ( $HOME is same as ~)
<rishi> (iii) .. --> parent directory of current directory
<rishi> (iv) . --> current directory as shown by pwd
<rishi> So if we are currently working under /devel/gengetopt/fedora/gengetopt/F-9
<rishi> ... we have:
<susenj> !
<rishi> [rishi@ginger F-9]$ pwd
<rishi> [rishi@ginger F-9]$ dirname /devel/gengetopt/fedora/gengetopt/F-9
<rishi> [rishi@ginger F-9]$ basename /devel/gengetopt/fedora/gengetopt/F-9
<rishi> F-9
<rishi> [rishi@ginger F-9]$
<rishi> susenj: Ask.
<susenj> is there a difference between cd.. and cd<space>..              ??
<susenj> what i did is:
<rishi> susenj: A world of difference.
<rishi> 'cd..' means you are trying to invoke a command named 'cd..', which is usually not present.
<rishi> 'cd ..' means you are invoking the cd command with .. as its argument.
<roni> !
<rishi> susenj: Anything else?
<susenj> but sometimes both works same and sometimes differ
<Soumya> both works ??
<rishi> roni: 'cd..' will not work if you did not create a command named 'cd..'.
<roni> i used this       [aritra@desktop ~]$ pwd
<susenj> [root@localhost ~]# cd D*
<Soumya> roni, let rishi finish
<susenj> [root@localhost Desktop]# cd..
<susenj> bash: cd..: command not found
<susenj> [root@localhost Desktop]# cd ..
<susenj> [root@localhost ~]#
<susenj> i tried this
<susenj> <eof>
<Soumya> cd.. (You already got the answer by the bash shell, as COMMAND NOT FOUND) <EOF>
<roni> it gave           /home/aritra
<roni> but then i did    [aritra@desktop ~]$ cd ..
<roni>                
<roni> [aritra@desktop home]$ pwd
<roni>                         it gave      /home
<roni> now when home and ~ are same
<roni> then why home is being shown suddenly?
<roni> <eof>
<Soumya> rishi, !
<TanmayaT> !
* amrita (n=amrita@117.201.96.141) has joined #dgplug
<kushal> roni, type 'pwd' in /home
<kushal> roni, and also in '~'
<Soumya> roni by home rishi meant <your home>
<kushal> roni, and see if both are same or not
<Soumya> so when you see ~ it means /home/roni <if roni is the user name you logged in through>
<Soumya> when you do cd ..
<Soumya> it means you went to the folder /home which is common for all the users in a unix/linux enviornment
<Soumya> thus /home doesnt mean its /home/roni got it ??
<roni> then how to come back to     [aritra@desktop ~]$
<kushal> roni, cd
<roni> got the previous thing
<Soumya> whats user name you are using ?
<roni> aritra@desktop
<Soumya> not cd kushal it would be cd -
<roni> yeah i got you
<Soumya> you do cd /home/aritra
<kushal> Soumya, his question is how to come to ~ which is home, so the command is only 'cd'
<Soumya> i think your machine name is aritra
<Soumya> sorry desktop
<roni> yes
<roni> kushal da s solution worked
<susenj> you may type in cd root also
<Soumya> ya then do that
<kushal> btw, whoever never typed their names, please do so
<kushal> I think rishi is offline for some reason
<Soumya> both does same kushal
<Soumya> oks roni
<roni> yes
<kushal> Soumya, only in that situation
<kushal> Soumya, 'cd' is to go back to your home folder from any location
<kushal> 'cd -' is to go back to last directory
<Soumya> ya that i know kushal
<mavu_> is the class on.. of can i ask a little offtrack but a path related query?
<mavu_> s/of/or
<Soumya> i was telling going to ~ you can do 'cd' also you can do cd /home/username
<kushal> mavu_, class is on , but still ask
<mavu_> :) by class  not being on.. i meant rishi not being here.. thanks .. what i wantes to know is... if i have a software that i meed to manually install .. which also needs me to compile a few java programs...
<mavu_> so.. when i give absolute names
<mavu_> pathnames taht is
<mavu_> in javac.. it does not work
<mavu_> if i give a javac  from an intermediate directory
<mavu_> in the path
<mavu_> it works
<rtnpro> kushal, Hello
<mavu_> but i want it to work from the place that i want to install it
<Subhodip> mavu_, thats a problem with your classpath 
<kushal> mavu_, use classpath
<kushal> -cp
<rtnpro> kushal, Its boring not trying these commands in the terminal
<ria> Soumya, ping
<Soumya> ria, pong
<Subhodip> mavu_, it depends what you have set as classpath 
<mavu_> okay... i figured that out for my comp.. but when i package the software up
<rtnpro> kushal, the lsusb command shows the modem
<mavu_> and someone else installs
<mavu_> then how do i set the classpath
<Subhodip> mavu_, in that case use rpm packaging rules 
<rtnpro> kushal, but wvdial does not detect it
<kushal> mavu_, export $CLASSPATH
<mavu_> okay
<coolpyro> mavu_: edit ur path env var.
<rtnpro> What can I do?
<mavu_> :) thanks
<kushal> rtnpro, don't know, come to ##linux-india adn ask there
<Subhodip> mavu_, search the fedora wiki for the same 
<coolpyro> mavu_: add da path of ur javac to that variable
<mavu_> hmm
<susenj> yes ,coolpyro ,you are right!
