Jul 01 23:17:12 <kushal>	ria, hardware devices, like your hard disk, DVD writer , ram, 
Jul 01 23:17:26 <arpita>	Kishan_, yes inside /dev i can see same files as in /boot
Jul 01 23:17:26 <kushal>	ecntrk_, yes 
Jul 01 23:17:37 <ecntrk_>	why there is s many rams?
Jul 01 23:17:41 <arpita>	kushal, yes inside /dev i can see same files as in /boot

Jul 01 23:18:51 <ria>	<eof>
Jul 01 23:18:57 <kushal>	ria, so it is like you want to read something from your harddisk, you can read it from /dev/sda 
Jul 01 23:19:10 <ria>	kushal, that i know
Jul 01 23:19:17 <arpita>	kushal, on doing cd dev and then doing ls i can see the device files
Jul 01 23:19:17 <kushal>	ria, means using those files you can access the hardware
Jul 01 23:19:20 <ria>	kushal, i am talking about ram
Jul 01 23:19:22 <aritra>	!
Jul 01 23:19:30 <kushal>	arpita, ok
Jul 01 23:19:36 <ria>	kushal, i know about the /dev/sda part
Jul 01 23:19:46 <kushal>	ria, same as hard disk that is yor ram, 
Jul 01 23:19:46 <ria>	kushal, but the ram part is not clear
Jul 01 23:20:00 <kushal>	ria, so the kernel is accessing those devices as required 
Jul 01 23:20:10 <ecntrk_>	but whay there are soo many rams? ram0, ram1..
Jul 01 23:20:10 <ria>	in /dev/sda we see files and folders

Jul 01 23:22:12 <deepak>	kushal:please take queries at the end
Jul 01 23:22:44 <kushal>	tty are terminal devices, and we can have many terminals in a running system  
Jul 01 23:23:00 <kushal>	deepak, today I want to take questions in between 
Jul 01 23:23:11 <deepak>	kushal:ok
Jul 01 23:23:12 <aritra>	so many, why?
Jul 01 23:23:39 <kushal>	aritra, you can have many terminals basically 
Jul 01 23:24:03 <aritra>	got it
Jul 01 23:24:07 <kushal>	nex /etc
Jul 01 23:24:09 <kushal>	next 
Jul 01 23:24:33 <kushal>	 /etc folder contains all  configuration files 
Jul 01 23:24:46 <kushal>	and only configuration files 
Jul 01 23:24:55 <kushal>	no binary or other files goes there
Jul 01 23:25:23 <kushal>	and generally these files are static , no need to change unless you are changing some configuration 
Jul 01 23:25:40 <kushal>	some really interesting files are there 
Jul 01 23:25:58 <kushal>	which we will see in details later other time 
Jul 01 23:26:10 <kushal>	next is /home 
Jul 01 23:26:28 <ecntrk_>	!
Jul 01 23:26:36 <kushal>	from the name you can understand it is the home directory where all users home folders generally located
Jul 01 23:26:49 <kushal>	so if you do 'cd' and then pwd
Jul 01 23:27:02 <kushal>	you can something like '/home/username' 
Jul 01 23:27:24 <kushal>	and if cd /home , and the ls , then you can see folders for all users
Jul 01 23:27:28 <kushal>	ecntrk_, yes please 
Jul 01 23:27:53 <ecntrk_>	what rc _> somefilename
Jul 01 23:27:55 <ecntrk_>	means?
Jul 01 23:28:10 <ecntrk_>	I mean.. what the operator _> means?

Jul 01 23:32:35 <kushal>	that is a special folder from the os, to keep some files which may get deleted in the process sometime (specially booked for the system) 
Jul 01 23:32:38 <kushal>	iirc 
Jul 01 23:33:00 <kushal>	ria, as your /home is in a different partition you can see it

Jul 01 23:40:06 <kushal>	this folder mounts all removable media, like your CDs or DVDs or USB pen drive 
Jul 01 23:40:35 <kushal>	so whenever you put a pen drive in your system, you can see it as a folder in /media 
Jul 01 23:41:41 <kushal>	next /mnt , where we mount any other filesystem , like your windows partition or a network file system  
Jul 01 23:42:24 <Prakhar>	!
Jul 01 23:42:42 <kushal>	Prakhar, yes 
Jul 01 23:43:06 <Prakhar>	do we have to manually mount the partitions, or they are done automatically on boot?
Jul 01 23:43:19 <Pramit>	!
Jul 01 23:43:20 *	Debashree_ has quit (Client Quit)
Jul 01 23:43:25 <kushal>	Prakhar, depends on how they are configured 
Jul 01 23:43:26 <Prakhar>	because, I had to do it manually.
Jul 01 23:43:33 <Prakhar>	ok
Jul 01 23:43:48 <kushal>	Prakhar, you can write them in /etc/fstab file if you know how to 
Jul 01 23:43:51 <kushal>	Pramit, 
Jul 01 23:43:55 <Pramit>	in case of automount (f9) where they r mounted?
Jul 01 23:44:29 <Prakhar>	<eof>
Jul 01 23:44:32 <kushal>	Pramit, what is "r" ?
Jul 01 23:44:33 *	susenj has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
Jul 01 23:44:43 <kushal>	Pramit, and they == ?
Jul 01 23:44:49 <Pramit>	sorry. are
Jul 01 23:45:10 <kushal>	Pramit, like automount of your windows partition ?
Jul 01 23:45:17 <kushal>	Pramit, in fedora , /media 
Jul 01 23:45:26 <Prakhar>	!
Jul 01 23:45:37 <kushal>	Prakhar, yes 
Jul 01 23:46:00 <arpita>	!
Jul 01 23:46:06 <kushal>	aritra, yes please 
Jul 01 23:46:22 <Prakhar>	yes, i was about to say this. /media is used for mounting partitions in fedora. then why is it told to do it explicitly in /mnt if they are not detected automatically?
Jul 01 23:46:38 <Pramit>	manually i can mount a drive in /mnt but in automount they are mounted in /media?
Jul 01 23:47:04 <Prakhar>	Pramit, thanks for re-phrasing it.
Jul 01 23:47:12 <kushal>	Prakhar, yes 
Jul 01 23:47:18 <aritra>	kushal, why are you making me arpita
Jul 01 23:47:28 <aritra>	?
Jul 01 23:47:31 <kushal>	aritra, ssorry for that 
Jul 01 23:47:34 <kushal>	typo
Jul 01 23:47:37 <kushal>	arpita, yes 
Jul 01 23:47:39 <aritra>	:)
Jul 01 23:47:53 <kushal>	Prakhar, you can actually mount anywhere you want 
Jul 01 23:48:19 <Prakhar>	it doesn't make any difference?
Jul 01 23:48:23 <Pramit>	!
Jul 01 23:48:36 <kushal>	Prakhar, is that a sentence or a question ?
Jul 01 23:48:49 <Prakhar>	question please.
Jul 01 23:48:55 <arpita>	on doing ls inside mnt no file names are being shown
Jul 01 23:49:10 <kushal>	aritra, yes, as by default nothing is mounted there 
Jul 01 23:49:27 <amrita>	kushal, !
Jul 01 23:49:44 <kushal>	Prakhar, no from users pint of view, but may be some applications depends on the standard 
Jul 01 23:49:49 <kushal>	Pramit, yes
Jul 01 23:50:05 <kushal>	arpita, ^^ see the above 
Jul 01 23:50:06 <Pramit>	i can use automounted drives in root.but can not write in user. why?
Jul 01 23:50:11 <Prakhar>	ok, <eof>
Jul 01 23:50:29 <kushal>	Pramit, do a ls -l , you should understand 
Jul 01 23:50:33 <kushal>	amrita, yes 
Jul 01 23:50:35 <amrita>	kushal, can't understand the function of mnt
Jul 01 23:51:16 <kushal>	amrita, like you are in a lan , and some server is sharing some files using Samba or windows file sharing 
Jul 01 23:51:30 <kushal>	amrita, and you want to access them as local file or folder
Jul 01 23:51:30 <arpita>	kushal, ls -l is showing total 0 as output
Jul 01 23:51:39 *	rsa_md5 (n=droopy@117.194.2.15) has left #dgplug ("Leaving")
Jul 01 23:51:54 <kushal>	amrita, then you can mount it in /mnt 
Jul 01 23:52:02 <kushal>	arpita, yes, that is what I said above 
Jul 01 23:52:39 <kushal>	anything else ?
Jul 01 23:53:21 <kushal>	 /opt folder, where we can keep addition software , which actually comes from old UNIX days 
Jul 01 23:53:29 <kushal>	 and then /root 
Jul 01 23:53:49 <kushal>	  /root is the home folder of the *root* user 
Jul 01 23:53:51 <arpita>	kushal, what does thios output total 0 mean?
Jul 01 23:54:11 <kushal>	this is different than root folder which is  "/"
Jul 01 23:54:26 <kushal>	arpita, means Zero , means No folder or file 
Jul 01 23:54:48 *	coolpyro_rishi (n=chatzill@202.63.119.36) has joined #dgplug
Jul 01 23:55:02 <amrita>	kushal, !
Jul 01 23:55:11 <kushal>	like all your user accounts have home folder in /home 
Jul 01 23:55:23 <kushal>	root account is having home folder as /root 
Jul 01 23:55:26 <kushal>	amrita, yes please
Jul 01 23:55:47 <amrita>	kushal, additional software? give example please
Jul 01 23:56:31 <kushal>	amrita, like software from any other software vendor, may be like apache tomcat 
Jul 01 23:57:28 <kushal>	 next folder is /sbin where we keep special commands for the system admin 
Jul 01 23:57:44 <kushal>	these are only accessible for the root user
Jul 01 23:58:04 <kushal>	it contains commands like reboot , fdisk , 
Jul 01 23:58:49 <kushal>	next is /srv 
Jul 01 23:59:18 <kushal>	this folder is used by the services specific data from the syste, 
Jul 01 23:59:20 <kushal>	system 
Jul 02 00:00:02 <kushal>	you can know more about different services in the sys admin class
Jul 02 00:00:14 <Pramit>	!
Jul 02 00:00:26 <kushal>	Pramit, yes
Jul 02 00:00:39 <Pramit>	what is mean by  "services specific data"
Jul 02 00:01:11 <Pramit>	?
Jul 02 00:01:14 <kushal>	Pramit, you can only understand that if you know what is a service 
Jul 02 00:01:24 <kushal>	beyond our scope for now 
Jul 02 00:01:34 <kushal>	next is /tmp 
Jul 02 00:01:47 <kushal>	where all applications keep temporary files 
Jul 02 00:02:26 <kushal>	It is recommended that while rebooting the system all files in the /tmp should be deleted 
Jul 02 00:02:41 <kushal>	but that depends on the OS
Jul 02 00:02:56 <kushal>	next is another very big place called /usr
Jul 02 00:03:19 *	amrita has quit ("Leaving")
Jul 02 00:03:37 <kushal>	 /usr is readonly data, that means no writing there 
Jul 02 00:03:58 <kushal>	it contains folders like
Jul 02 00:04:10 <kushal>	 bin -- where many common user commands can be found
Jul 02 00:04:32 <kushal>	include -- where we can find all C include files 
Jul 02 00:04:59 <Pramit>	!
Jul 02 00:05:02 <kushal>	lib --- which contains libraries which to be used by particular applications
Jul 02 00:05:26 <kushal>	sbin -- non essential sys admin commands
Jul 02 00:05:51 <kushal>	Pramit, yes
Jul 02 00:05:56 <Pramit>	readonly means readonly for root also?
Jul 02 00:06:26 *	suse_nj is now known as susenj
Jul 02 00:06:55 <kushal>	Pramit, read only means, where no one should write
Jul 02 00:07:16 <kushal>	even root should not write anything there (though root can do anything there )
Jul 02 00:08:22 <kushal>	not /usr/share is architecture independent data, that means data kept here does not depend on your i386 or i686 or PPC arcitecture 
Jul 02 00:08:35 <kushal>	architecture 
Jul 02 00:08:53 <kushal>	so we can find man files there in /usr/share/man 
Jul 02 00:09:06 <kushal>	and some other folders 
Jul 02 00:09:28 <kushal>	there is a folder called /usr/local 
Jul 02 00:09:43 <kushal>	which contains almost same folder structure as root
Jul 02 00:09:46 <Pramit>	"even root should not write anything there (though root can do anything there )" i can not understand this line.
Jul 02 00:10:10 <kushal>	Pramit, root can do anything in any place in the system 
Jul 02 00:10:47 <kushal>	Pramit, in /usr root user also should not write anything unless it is installing/removing any application 
Jul 02 00:11:20 <Pramit>	ok<eof>
Jul 02 00:11:40 *	amrita (n=amrita@117.201.96.183) has joined #dgplug
Jul 02 00:12:02 <kushal>	so if we install a software from source generally it goes to /usr/local as it is meant to be used by the system admin 
Jul 02 00:12:29 <kushal>	next is /var which contains variable data files 
Jul 02 00:12:48 <kushal>	variables means which get changed 
Jul 02 00:13:22 <kushal>	like in /var/log folder all applications keep their log, which changes through out when the system is running 
Jul 02 00:13:46 <kushal>	/var/tmp is again another temporary folder 
Jul 02 00:14:20 <kushal>	 /var/cache keeps application specific cached informations
Jul 02 00:14:25 <kushal>	 /var/cache keeps application specific cached information 
Jul 02 00:14:49 <kushal>	like for fedora systems, yum keeps its cache in /var/cache/yum 
Jul 02 00:15:05 <ecntrk_>	!
Jul 02 00:15:20 <kushal>	ecntrk_, yes please 
Jul 02 00:15:22 <ecntrk_>	is cache is related to swap memory?
Jul 02 00:15:27 <kushal>	ecntrk_, no
Jul 02 00:15:37 <ecntrk_>	like not physical cache.. i guess..
Jul 02 00:15:41 *	Pramit has quit ("ChatZilla 0.9.83 [Firefox 3.0/2008052906]")
Jul 02 00:15:54 <ecntrk_>	is it then only HD space?<eof>
Jul 02 00:16:26 <kushal>	ecntrk_, no, cache for applications, like yum search a rpm first in cache, if found then it installs from there or else it downloads it and then install 
Jul 02 00:16:43 <kushal>	* searches 
Jul 02 00:17:42 <ecntrk_>	no..i'm telling.. is it the hard disk space?<eof>
Jul 02 00:17:49 <kushal>	means ?
Jul 02 00:18:00 <ecntrk_>	where do cache reside?
Jul 02 00:18:12 <kushal>	ecntrk_, /var/cache is a folder in hard disk in the root partition 
Jul 02 00:18:22 <ecntrk_>	in HD or in RAM or in real Cache?
Jul 02 00:18:24 <kushal>	under root var, under var cache 
Jul 02 00:18:29 <ecntrk_>	oh.. I got that..<eof>
Jul 02 00:18:38 <kushal>	ok
Jul 02 00:18:42 <kushal>	questions please 
Jul 02 00:18:47 <ecntrk_>	!
Jul 02 00:18:51 <kushal>	ecntrk_, please
Jul 02 00:18:57 <Prakhar>	!
Jul 02 00:18:59 <ecntrk_>	what about selinux...
Jul 02 00:19:00 <ecntrk_>	?
Jul 02 00:19:06 <ecntrk_>	<eof>
Jul 02 00:19:36 <kushal>	ecntrk_, that is not a part of the FHS yer

Jul 02 00:20:28 <kushal>	ecntrk_, yes we do have , but that is not part of the standard, please refer to the pdf in topic 
Jul 02 00:20:31 <kushal>	ria, yes 
Jul 02 00:20:40 <ria>	kushal, are these partitions same for all distros?
Jul 02 00:20:45 <ria>	<eof>
Jul 02 00:21:22 <Subhodip>	i guess almost simmilar if not same
Jul 02 00:21:52 <kushal>	ria, what we discussed still now is the Filesystem Standard , so all major GNU/linux distributions follow this structure 
Jul 02 00:22:20 <kushal>	ria, to know more read the pdf and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard
Jul 02 00:23:24 <kushal>	anymore questions /

Jul 02 00:24:24 <kushal>	Prakhar, yes 
Jul 02 00:24:33 <Prakhar>	what about /proc
Jul 02 00:24:56 <kushal>	oh I missed it 
Jul 02 00:25:03 <Prakhar>	:)
Jul 02 00:25:39 <kushal>	 /proc is a special system all together 
Jul 02 00:25:46 <kushal>	it is a virtual system 
Jul 02 00:26:06 <kushal>	it gives runtime process informations
