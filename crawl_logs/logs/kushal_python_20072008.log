Jul 20 19:46:00 <kushal>	ria, let me check the code 
Jul 20 19:46:04 <kushal>	others ?
Jul 20 19:46:07 <ria>	kushal, ya sure
Jul 20 19:46:13 <ria>	kushal, its working
Jul 20 19:46:38 <kushal>	ria, almost 
Jul 20 19:46:46 <kushal>	ria, try with TCS.NS
Jul 20 19:46:48 <kushal>	:p
Jul 20 19:46:51 <ria>	ok
Jul 20 19:47:13 <ria>	kushal, working

Jul 20 19:47:24 <kushal>	ria, nope
Jul 20 19:47:29 <kushal>	ria, check the webpage 
Jul 20 19:47:36 <kushal>	ria, the last trade value 
Jul 20 19:47:49 <kushal>	ria, and what your code is showing 
Jul 20 19:47:49 <ria>	ya i think the total number is not given
Jul 20 19:47:53 <kushal>	ria, yes
Jul 20 19:48:01 <ria>	the decimal
Jul 20 19:48:10 <kushal>	ria, that means you need a better way to fetch the data 
Jul 20 19:48:20 <ria>	kushal, i can print untill < is encountered
Jul 20 19:48:29 <ria>	i think that will work
Jul 20 19:48:30 <kushal>	ria, that you decide :p
Jul 20 19:48:35 <ria>	ya
Jul 20 19:48:36 <ria>	ok
Jul 20 19:48:48 <ria>	kushal, but that way it will work i think

Jul 20 19:52:16 <kushal>	Debashree, that is something ria figured out, 
Jul 20 19:52:29 <kushal>	amrita, that is the problem you should solve :p
Jul 20 19:52:35 <Debashree_>	kushal, yes how did she do it?

Jul 20 20:03:19 <kushal>	sunny_slls, try to present in the sessions or else you will not understand many things 
Jul 20 20:03:28 <ria>	arpita, in the program
Jul 20 20:03:56 <ria>	10th line will find 'last trade'
Jul 20 20:04:02 <ria>	which you did manually now
Jul 20 20:04:15 <ria>	as data means the page source
Jul 20 20:04:16 <sunny_slls>	kushal, ok
Jul 20 20:04:24 <ria>	arpita, up to this ok?
Jul 20 20:04:27 <ria>	clear?

Jul 20 20:04:49 <ria>	no no
Jul 20 20:04:58 <ria>	i am not talking about the value
Jul 20 20:04:58 <sunny_slls>	but please explain the question?
Jul 20 20:05:15 <ria>	x = data.find('Last Trade:')
Jul 20 20:05:26 <ria>	when you do this
Jul 20 20:05:36 <ria>	the string last trade is found
Jul 20 20:05:44 <ria>	from the page source
Jul 20 20:06:00 <arpita>	ria, o.k only the string last trade is found on doing so not the value?
Jul 20 20:06:08 <kushal>	sunny_slls, from finance.yahoo.com you have to fetch the last trade value for any given company 
Jul 20 20:06:16 <ria>	ya arpita
Jul 20 20:06:22 <sunny_slls>	kushal, !
Jul 20 20:06:27 <ria>	so x is the position of last trade
Jul 20 20:06:36 <ria>	a numerical value
Jul 20 20:06:51 <kushal>	sunny_slls, yes 
Jul 20 20:06:53 <ria>	you can do help(str)
Jul 20 20:07:09 <ria>	to see what find does
Jul 20 20:07:14 <ria>	arpita, ok?
Jul 20 20:07:26 <ria>	now see
Jul 20 20:07:30 <sunny_slls>	kushal,how we can find the last trade value?
Jul 20 20:07:35 <arpita>	ria, yes
Jul 20 20:07:38 <kushal>	sunny_slls, that is the problem 
Jul 20 20:07:45 <ria>	go the page source
Jul 20 20:07:58 <kushal>	sunny_slls, you are supposed to solve it, now ria is telling how she did that
Jul 20 20:08:13 <ria>	now you see
Jul 20 20:08:23 *	bose_aritra has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
Jul 20 20:08:30 <ria>	after last trade string you will find the value
Jul 20 20:08:35 <ria>	in page source
Jul 20 20:08:53 <ria>	in between them there are lot of other things
Jul 20 20:09:00 <ria>	i mean the HTML code
Jul 20 20:09:03 <amrita>	kushal, not that module page
Jul 20 20:09:16 <ria>	arpita, did you get that?
Jul 20 20:09:36 <kushal>	amrita, there you can find it, open your eyes :)
Jul 20 20:09:49 <kishanGoyal>	got it...
Jul 20 20:10:04 <arpita>	ria,last trade value then some html code then it is written 10.81
Jul 20 20:10:05 <ria>	arpita, did you get 10.81?
Jul 20 20:10:11 <ria>	ya
Jul 20 20:10:17 <arpita>	ria,yes got it
Jul 20 20:10:25 <kishanGoyal>	10.81..yes...
Jul 20 20:10:26 <ria>	i have counted the number how far it is

Jul 20 20:10:42 <ria>	a rough count though
Jul 20 20:11:03 <ria>	i mistakenly counted wrong

Jul 20 20:11:16 <ria>	anyways the number is 52
Jul 20 20:11:31 <kushal>	sunny_slls, yes
Jul 20 20:11:37 <sunny_slls>	not understood
Jul 20 20:11:42 <ria>	i mean 52 letters in between
Jul 20 20:11:46 <ria>	arpita, ok?
Jul 20 20:12:14 <arpita>	ria,o.k
Jul 20 20:12:16 <kushal>	sunny_slls, that is the problem you are supposed to solve 
Jul 20 20:12:29 <ria>	now see the program
Jul 20 20:12:49 <ria>	12th line
Jul 20 20:13:04 <ria>	xx = x + 52
Jul 20 20:13:10 *	Prakhar (n=prakhar@122.163.71.100) has joined #dgplug

Jul 20 20:13:17 <ria>	x was the position of last trade
Jul 20 20:13:18 <sunny_slls>	but i can't understand anything..
Jul 20 20:13:44 <kushal>	sunny_slls, good, so be in session or else next sessions you will not understand anything 
Jul 20 20:13:46 <ria>	arpita, i did less counting i printed and i made changes
Jul 20 20:13:58 <ria>	arpita, check that later
Jul 20 20:14:11 <ria>	when you print you will understand
Jul 20 20:14:19 <arpita>	ria,o.k
Jul 20 20:14:30 <arpita>	are blank spaces counted??

Jul 20 20:15:16 <kushal>	first found the place for "Last Trade:" 
Jul 20 20:15:23 *	Debashree_ has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
Jul 20 20:15:24 <ria>	so x was the last trade position
Jul 20 20:15:31 <ria>	kushal, just wait a minute
Jul 20 20:15:35 <arpita>	ria,cannot understand last line of the program
Jul 20 20:15:46 <kushal>	then took from next 53rd char to 72th one (72 is a random number) 
Jul 20 20:15:48 <kushal>	ria, ok
Jul 20 20:16:13 *	amrita_ (n=amrita@117.201.97.188) has joined #dgplug

Jul 20 20:17:40 <arpita>	o.k o.k
Jul 20 20:17:41 <ria>	1 in 10
Jul 20 20:17:42 <arpita>	got it
Jul 20 20:17:56 <arpita>	it is the position of 1 of 10.81??
Jul 20 20:17:58 <ria>	so you need to print upto 1
Jul 20 20:18:05 <ria>	of 81
Jul 20 20:18:06 <arpita>	ria,yes
Jul 20 20:18:13 <ria>	so total 5 characters
