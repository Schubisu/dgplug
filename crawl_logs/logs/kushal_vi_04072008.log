Jul 04 19:10:13 <kushal>	To check the power of the tags in vi, you need some code where you can use it

Jul 04 19:21:49 <arpita>	kushal, sorry
Jul 04 19:22:23 <kushal>	you all remember how we can issue shell commands in vi
Jul 04 19:22:29 <Debashree>	arpita, yes just now i returned
Jul 04 19:22:45 <kushal>	to create tags , we are going to use command ctags
Jul 04 19:23:10 <kushal>	syntax for ctags  is
Jul 04 19:23:17 <kushal>	ctags *.[ch]
Jul 04 19:23:44 <kushal>	^^ above means any for any filename where it ends with .c or .h
Jul 04 19:24:06 <kushal>	so, tell me how can I run that command inside of vi ?
Jul 04 19:24:58 <kushal>	anyone ?
Jul 04 19:25:04 <susenj>	in command mode just typing this :ctags *.[ch]
Jul 04 19:25:08 <susenj>	just a guess
Jul 04 19:25:13 <susenj>	<eof>
Jul 04 19:25:28 <kushal>	susenj, that means you are *not* studying seriously 
Jul 04 19:25:46 <kushal>	susenj, and also not taking classes seriously 
Jul 04 19:26:01 <kushal>	susenj, don't guess things which have been taught

Jul 04 20:03:56 <kushal>	now , you can search different tags in source code 
Jul 04 20:03:59 <ria>	kushal, ya but i thought of dowloading from there to get the exact one
Jul 04 20:04:08 <ria>	<eof>
Jul 04 20:04:32 <kushal>	ria, it is supposed to students' duty to maintain log

Jul 04 20:11:48 <arpita>	that was vi pyrfid.c
Jul 04 20:11:50 <ria>	is it the third brakett?
Jul 04 20:11:54 <kushal>	ria, yes 
Jul 04 20:11:58 <rtnpro>	arpita, vi <filename>
Jul 04 20:12:02 <ria>	ctrl + third brakett?

Jul 04 20:12:49 <kushal>	ok, moving on
Jul 04 20:12:50 <ria>	it gives ctags not found kushal
Jul 04 20:13:00 <kushal>	ria, where you tried ?
Jul 04 20:13:01 <ria>	did not work for me
Jul 04 20:13:51 <ria>	i went to line 79 and then to 'o' of openpcd_open_reader(&handle))
Jul 04 20:14:06 <ria>	after that pressed ctrl + }
Jul 04 20:14:12 <kushal>	ria, ^^ 
Jul 04 20:14:18 <ria>	*ctrl + ]
Jul 04 20:14:45 <rtnpro>	kushal, !
Jul 04 20:14:50 <kushal>	ria, do you have openpcd.c ?
Jul 04 20:14:53 <kushal>	rtnpro, yes 
Jul 04 20:15:12 <rtnpro>	why did we do "!ctags *.[ch]"
Jul 04 20:15:29 <ria>	kushal, yes
Jul 04 20:15:41 <ria>	openpcd.c ^^
Jul 04 20:15:47 <rtnpro>	kushal, what's the significance of the tags file?
Jul 04 20:15:49 <kushal>	rtnpro, we used ctags command on all .c and .h files in the current directory to create tags files 
Jul 04 20:16:16 <kushal>	mbuf, ^^ you talked about this ?
Jul 04 20:16:39 <rtnpro>	kushal, I opened tags through vi
Jul 04 20:16:50 <kushal>	rtnpro, so ?
Jul 04 20:16:59 <kushal>	then ?
Jul 04 20:17:01 <mbuf>	kushal, use "find . -type f -name '*.[ch]' | xargs etags -a"
Jul 04 20:17:06 *	techno_freak has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
Jul 04 20:17:22 <rtnpro>	there are a lot of .c and .h names written out there
Jul 04 20:17:25 <kushal>	mbuf, I mean you told them about tags ?
Jul 04 20:17:30 <mbuf>	kushal, yes
Jul 04 20:17:35 <kushal>	rtnpro, yes
Jul 04 20:17:44 <kushal>	rtnpro, see last night's log 
Jul 04 20:17:49 <rtnpro>	kushal, but I can't relate that
Jul 04 20:18:19 <rtnpro>	kushal, I am not understanding what I see in the tags file
Jul 04 20:18:32 <kushal>	rtnpro, this tags file is kind of database for all tags in the code, like for functions, variables 
Jul 04 20:18:40 <kushal>	rtnpro, yes
Jul 04 20:19:04 <kushal>	rtnpro, so for now just do what I say, then do all experiments 
Jul 04 20:19:12 <rtnpro>	kushal, are the numbers the location of the functions?
Jul 04 20:19:16 <kushal>	ria, we will see your problem later 
Jul 04 20:19:19 <rtnpro>	ok
Jul 04 20:19:59 <kushal>	so after the first step, you can see in the line 203 ( 2 lines below) openpcd_state 
Jul 04 20:20:13 <kushal>	so take your cursor there and press Ctrl + ]
Jul 04 20:21:24 <kushal>	you will find 2 options given 
Jul 04 20:21:31 <rtnpro>	It says choice number
Jul 04 20:21:36 <kushal>	there is a kind column 
Jul 04 20:21:44 <kushal>	written as s and v
Jul 04 20:21:54 <kushal>	where s == structure , v = variable 
Jul 04 20:22:01 <rtnpro>	yes
Jul 04 20:22:03 <ria>	!
Jul 04 20:22:14 <kushal>	if somewhere it shows f, it means fuction 
Jul 04 20:22:20 <kushal>	* function
