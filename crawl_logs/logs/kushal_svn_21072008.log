Jul 21 19:11:23 <kushal>	Tonight we are going to discuss about Subversion or svn
Jul 21 19:11:32 <kushal>	svn is a version control tool 
Jul 21 19:11:47 <kushal>	it means you can keep your files with version numbers 
Jul 21 19:12:01 <kushal>	so that you can change to any version any time you need 
Jul 21 19:12:32 <sunny_slls>	Sunny Sharma
Jul 21 19:12:52 <kushal>	it also helps to collaboration and development 
Jul 21 19:13:11 <debayan>	Debayan Banerjee
Jul 21 19:13:15 <kushal>	more basic details can be found 
Jul 21 19:13:39 <kushal>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_(software)
Jul 21 19:14:17 <kushal>	the book you should follow 
Jul 21 19:14:32 <kushal>	http://svnbook.red-bean.com/
Jul 21 19:14:40 <kushal>	but we will see it later 
Jul 21 19:15:24 <kushal>	basically it looks like this
Jul 21 19:15:34 <kushal>	there will be a central repository 
Jul 21 19:15:39 <kushal>	somewhere in the web 
Jul 21 19:15:48 <kushal>	we all will check code from there 
Jul 21 19:16:11 <kushal>	code/doc/art/music/ whatever
Jul 21 19:16:14 <kushal>	then
Jul 21 19:16:24 <kushal>	we will do local changes 
Jul 21 19:16:44 <kushal>	then we will send the changes to the main place 
Jul 21 19:17:28 <kushal>	we call the main place/people as upstream people as they do the actual work (if you have a svn account , that means you are also a upstream)
Jul 21 19:18:08 <kushal>	so, every one, please create a directory in your home folder, where you will do the svn work
