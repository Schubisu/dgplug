[14:18:16] <Christina> Reading state information... Done
[14:18:16] <Christina> Package git is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[14:18:16] <Christina> This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
[14:18:16] <Christina> is only available from another source
[14:18:16] <Christina> E: Package git has no installation candidate
[14:18:47] <kushal> Christina, please learn to use a pastebin such as fpaste.org
[14:19:06] <Christina> This is what i got on the terminal
[14:19:12] <Christina> kushal, ok
[14:19:15] <praveenkumar> Can someone from ubuntu background help Christina.
[14:19:24] <kushal> Christina, join #ubuntu and ask for help
[14:19:29] <kushal> coming back
[14:19:45] <kushal> for example you are writing an article
[14:20:01] <kushal> and you want to keep track of any changes
[14:20:41] <kushal> you may also want to keep track of any changes made by your teammates etc
[14:20:47] <kirk_iowa> Christina: What version of Ubuntu are you using?
[14:21:23] <kushal> we use a version control system to handle such cases
[14:22:30] <kushal> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control is the wiki link for the same
[14:22:56] <kushal> you can read it later
[14:23:23] <kushal> for our sessions we will learn a vcs (version control system) called git
[14:23:40] <Christina> kirk_iowa, I am sorry I am using it on vmware. took the image from a friend
[14:23:55] <Christina> so i don't know :(
[14:24:26] <kushal> it will be heavily used during python sessions and later during project times
[14:24:33] <dot|not> !
[14:24:43] <kushal> in FOSS world you will find many projects are using git
[14:24:46] <kushal> dot|not, ask
[14:25:36] <dot|not> Not really a question. Christina, please stop disturbing the class - I'm sure kirk_iowa will help you, as will most other people here will. But during class, please do this in a query.

[14:44:38] <kushal> Devyani, please use fpaste.org to show us both the command and the error
[14:44:57] <Devyani> kushal, ok.

[14:45:10] <fewcha> Devyani: install git first
[14:45:14] <kushal> Devyani, check if you at all installed git or not
[14:45:49] <Devyani> kushal, i did install
[14:46:53] <kushal> Devyani, so can you please show us the error ?
[14:46:56] <Devyani> it said  : divs not in sudoers file, incident will be noted
[14:47:05] <Devyani> does that mean, it is not installed?
[14:47:17] <kushal> Devyani, it means nothing
[14:47:41] <kushal> Devyani, and as you never showed us the command and the error pasted in fpaste.org, I will just continue
[14:47:57] <kushal> next, we will create a repository
[14:48:53] <kushal> a repository is place where we will keep these history and other files related to the projects
[14:49:26] <kushal> let us create a directory called ~/repo01
[14:49:30] <kushal> and go inside it
[14:50:26] <kushal> ~/ sign means it is under home directory
[14:51:03] <kushal> $ git init
[14:51:30] <kushal> it will confirm that it created an empty git repository
[14:52:17] <dell_> !
[14:52:19] <sankha> !
[14:52:28] <kushal> dell_, ask
[14:53:25] <dell_> http://fpaste.org "i will show as Intialized empty Git repository in home/manish/repo01/.git"
[14:53:37] <dell_> s/i/it
[14:53:56] <kushal> dell_, I am not sure what exactly you are smoking ?
[14:54:16] <kushal> sankha, ask
[14:54:18] <sankha> where should i make repo01 ?   /home$  mkdir repo01 ?
[14:54:32] <kushal> sankha, no, in your home directory
[14:54:58] <dell_> the output is shown as " Intialized empty Git repository in home/manish/repo01/.git" kushal
[14:55:15] <rahulch> !
[14:55:21] <kushal> dell_, yes, we know, you don't have to announce that
[14:55:25] <kushal> rahulch, ask
[14:55:48] <rahulch> shall we execute "git init" after being inside repo01?
[14:55:49] <dell_> kushal: ok. Just to confirm i ask.
[14:56:04] <kushal> rahulch, yes, read my lines above
[14:56:39] <kushal> create another directory inside repo01 called datafiles
[14:57:20] <korak> !
[14:57:40] <kushal> korak, ask
[14:58:06] <kushal> also create a file inside repo01 called progress.txt
[14:58:22] <kushal> inside it write
[14:58:28] <kushal> Summer Training
[14:58:31] <kushal> do it everyone
[14:59:05] <kushal> use vim to create the file
[14:59:31] <korak> kushal, when i have created ~/repo01 it showed "bash:root/repo01:no such file or directory"
[15:00:14] <kushal> btw, do not write "do it everyone" inside the file, that is a message in IRC
[15:00:24] <kushal> korak, are you using root account ?
[15:01:08] <kushal> korak, also if you can not create a directory then sorry, I can not help you
[15:01:16] <shantanu> korak, you dont have to write "~/" with mkdir
[15:01:39] <kushal> shantanu, he can if he wants
[15:02:05] <kushal> which will make sure that the directory is under home directory
[15:02:05] <shantanu> kushal, ok
[15:02:44] * praveenkumar points shantanu please try yourself once before commenting/suggesting.
[15:03:20] <kushal> if anyone is getting any error please ask here
[15:03:41] <kushal> anyway we are still inside repo01
[15:03:52] <kushal> now try $ git status
[15:04:04] <kirk_iowa> !
[15:04:19] <kushal> kirk_iowa, yes
[15:04:20] <kirk_iowa> do we save progress.txt?

[15:09:51] <tenstormavi> kushal, it shows that message is its desired message?
[15:10:04] <kushal> it says there is an untracked file

[15:11:57] <kushal> $ git add progress.txt
[15:13:18] <kushal> from now on I will paste the output in the channel so that it stays in the irc log
[15:13:36] <kushal> in general that is bad but we will do it so that later others can get it from log
[15:13:38] <kushal> [gitu@dhcp193-104 repo01]$ git status
[15:13:39] <kushal> # On branch master

[15:15:39] <sankha> !
[15:16:14] <kushal> $ git commit -m "First commit to our documentation"
[15:16:20] <kushal> sankha, ask
[15:16:23] <sankha> committed means saved or what ?
[15:16:50] <kushal> sankha, means it is saved in the repository
[15:17:08] <sankha> ok
[15:17:39] <kushal> now try $ git log
[15:17:52] <kushal> that will tell you the commit details you made
[15:18:27] <kushal> the value after commit is known as "commit hash"
[15:19:19] <kushal> the value actually uniquely identifies the commit
[15:19:34] <kushal> do $ ls -la
[15:19:36] rahulch_ is now known as rahulch
[15:19:47] <kushal> that will show you a .git directory
[15:19:52] <kushal> where all details goes
[15:19:59] <kushal> s/goes/go/
[15:20:00] <batul> What kushal meant to say was: where all details go
[15:21:06] <kushal> now edit the file add another line to the same file
[15:21:28] <kushal> "I am editing this file." without quotes write that in the progress.txt
[15:22:47] <kushal> remember it is in the second line
[15:22:53] <kushal> save and exit

[15:23:28] <rashmi> kushal,can you please tell what we need to do aftergit add progress.txt, i missed due to connection problem
[15:23:50] <kushal> rashmi, please get the log from a friend in pm, session is going on
[15:24:00] <kushal> $ git status
[15:24:00] <kushal> # On branch master
[15:24:00] <kushal> # Changes not staged for commit:

[15:24:00] <kushal> #   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
[15:24:02] <kushal> #
[15:24:04] <kushal> #	modified:   progress.txt
[15:24:06] <kushal> #
[15:24:08] <kushal> no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
[15:24:14] <rashmi> ok
[15:25:00] <kushal> this means that progress.txt file contains some changes which is yet to be committed
[15:25:41] <kushal> if you want to see what is exactly changed use $ git diff
[15:26:04] <kushal> + sign means this is added/edited
[15:26:20] <kushal> if there is a minus sign that means it was removed
[15:26:34] <kushal> now let us commit this change
[15:27:04] <sankha> !
[15:27:14] <supriya> !
[15:27:28] <rahulch> !
[15:27:48] <kushal> $ git add progress.txt
[15:27:54] <kushal> $ git commit -m "Adds a new line to the file"
[15:28:01] <kushal> do a git log after that
[15:28:16] <kushal> sankha, ask
[15:28:39] <sankha> git diff shows consecutively two line , --- a/progress.txt      +++ b/progress.txt    .   here  what  is meant by a and b?
[15:29:11] <fewcha> sankha: you will get minus sign showing the old lines, and plus sign showing the new lines (after modification)
[15:29:43] <J_Caselles> !
[15:29:44] <sankha> fewcha: and what for 'a' and 'b' ?
[15:29:55] <kushal> sankha, it shows the changes between two files, in this both are same
[15:30:04] <fewcha> sankha: for now, take them as 'old' and 'new'
[15:30:12] <sankha> ok
[15:30:20] <kushal> supriya, rahulch J_Caselles ask
[15:30:44] <rahulch> what does the text in quotes after "git commit -m" generally indicate?
[15:30:55] <supriya> what does -1 +1,3 mean?
[15:31:02] <supriya> in git diff?
[15:31:06] <kushal> rahulch, I am coming to that in few minutes
[15:31:16] <rahulch> kushal, okay
[15:31:17] <J_Caselles> git add is some sort of commit preparation? if I've changed some files, if I just put one on add, only this one will be commited, right?
[15:31:30] <kushal> J_Caselles, yes

[15:32:24] <kushal> that is known as commit message
[15:32:54] <kushal> which basically tells what this commit is about
[15:33:42] <kushal> general rule to follow: Always write that commit message in present tense
[15:34:03] <kushal> now create another file called names.txt
[15:34:21] <tenstormavi> !
[15:34:26] <kushal> and write "Linux" without quotes inside it
[15:34:30] <kushal> save and exit

[15:57:49] <kushal> tenstormavi, I guess no, also you are using the root account
[15:58:02] <kushal> tenstormavi, which is idiotic
[15:58:10] <kushal> using the root account for daily use
[15:58:12] <tenstormavi> kushal, sorry

[16:03:50] <kushal> sankha, yes, but that C of changes was capital
[16:04:29] <kushal> anyway think that we wrote wrong commit message in the last commit
[16:04:34] <kushal> we can actually change that
[16:04:40] <amresh> !
[16:04:54] <kushal> amresh, ask
[16:05:04] <amresh> if we have many files, do we need to do write name of each file in git add? no shortcut?
[16:05:46] <elita15> !
[16:05:59] <kushal> amresh, if you want to add all changes in the current commit there is a way to do that
[16:06:04] <kushal> we will learn them slowly
[16:06:11] <kushal> not now
[16:06:25] <kushal> elita15, ask

[16:06:34] <elita15> is this correct?
[16:06:35] <batul> What kushal meant to say was: we will learn it slowly
[16:06:55] <kushal> elita15, yes
[16:08:20] <kushal> we use --amend to change the commit message of the last commit
[16:08:21] <kushal> $ git commit --amend -m "Better documentation changes for starting"
[16:08:27] <kushal> and then $ git log
[16:08:31] <kushal> try and see

[16:11:20] <sankha> or there should be one commit message ?
[16:11:22] <siddhant> there is written end at the bottom of terminal not able to try any command what to do next?
[16:11:52] <supriya> done
[16:11:52] <J_Caselles> siddhant try press "q"
[16:11:54] <dell_> done
[16:12:08] <kushal> sankha, you can try to write both lines in the commit message
[16:12:16] <kushal> we will learn those in the next session
[16:12:19] <rahulch> !
[16:12:23] <kushal> rahulch, ask
[16:12:27] <J_Caselles> !
[16:12:32] <kushal> J_Caselles, ask
[16:12:41] <rahulch> is it possible to add directories to our repo?
[16:12:44] <J_Caselles> and if we need to correct an older commit?
[16:13:24] <kushal> rahulch, empty directories no, you can add any file inside a directory  and it will be automatically there
[16:13:43] <kushal> J_Caselles, that is tricky, I will tell that later
[16:13:53] <J_Caselles> kushal ok thanks
[16:13:58] <kushal> may be after 1 or two weeks :)
[16:14:10] <J_Caselles> kushal: hahaha
[16:14:13] <rahulch> kushal, suppose a directory contains some files, and we want to add that directory. is it possible?
[16:14:36] <kushal> rahulch, you can not add only the directory but add the files under it
[16:14:51] <kushal> then the directory will automatically come in the commit
[16:15:00] <kushal> we will take 1 hour 15 minutes break
[16:15:08] <kushal> roll call
