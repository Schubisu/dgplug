[17:40:09] <iam_sudip> Iam sudip
[17:40:34] <mac1733> Terry Mackin
[17:40:46] <rahulch> suppose there is a directory containing some files under it, and i am interested in adding the whole directory including the files under it. can it be done in any way other than individually adding the files and placing them under one common directory?

[17:41:24] <mapyth> Mayank Jha
[17:41:50] <kushal> rahulch, git add directory/*
[17:42:08] <rahulch> kushal, got it :)
[17:42:21] <kushal> so git log shows logs for the whole repository
[17:43:14] <kushal> can anyone guess which command will show logs of commits for a particular file ? do not answer if you already know
[17:44:21] <J_Caselles> git log filename?
[17:44:28] <kushal> J_Caselles, correct :D
[17:44:29] <kushal> try
[17:44:54] <shantanu> !
[17:45:13] <kushal> shantanu, ask
[17:45:26] <rahulch_> kushal, can you please repeat your instruction, if any? i had lost my connection :(
[17:45:33] <shantanu> kushal, tried. but it is showing log of both files
[17:46:13] <kushal> rahulch_, nothing done yet
[17:46:13] <shantanu> kushal, http://fpaste.org/21729/

[17:46:50] <shantanu> <eof>
[17:47:25] <kushal> shantanu, eeks, it seems you never followed anything we did till now
[17:48:00] <kushal> shantanu, your commit messages are totally off the hook
[17:48:04] <nilanjit> kushal, what if i made a mistake putting my second last commit? how can this be corrected <eof>
[17:48:15] <nilanjit> oops sorry
[17:48:18] <nilanjit> mistake
[17:48:31] <shantanu> kushal, but they were showing last time i did
[17:48:33] <kushal> nilanjit, generally you are not supposed to make changes to any of those old histories
[17:48:58] <kushal> shantanu, then I don't know what happened
[17:49:16] <nilanjit> kushal, ok
[17:49:16] <shantanu> ok
[17:49:29] <kushal> nilanjit, btw, why you asked out of turn ?

[17:50:53] <nilanjit> <eof>
[17:50:59] <kushal> nilanjit, like a cat walked on your keyboard and pressed the Enter key

[17:51:11] <kushal> git is distributed
[17:52:14] <nilanjit> kushal, sorry that cat was me
[17:52:29] <kushal> I will explain that later
[17:52:33] <kushal> nilanjit, no problem
[17:53:13] <kushal> generally the project decides one git repo in the internet as the primary place
[17:53:14] <nilanjit> thanks
[17:53:21] <kushal> others clone the repo from there
[17:53:36] <kushal> clone ==  I guess you can guess that
[17:53:53] <nilanjit> copy?
[17:53:55] <shantanu> kushal, copy

[18:15:10] <purva> yes
[18:15:17] <kushal> now
[18:15:34] <kushal> you can image repo01 from someone else , it may be there in internet
[18:15:50] <kushal> and clonedrepo1 is your cloned repo
[18:15:59] <kushal> so you can make any changes to this one
[18:16:21] <kushal> which will not reflect to the other repository you cloned from
[18:16:33] <kushal> btw, that repository is know as remote
[18:16:46] <kushal> there can be more than one remote
[18:16:58] <kushal> $ git remote
[18:17:16] <kushal> shows remote
[18:17:21] <kushal> $ git remote -v
[18:17:27] <kushal> shows the remote details
[18:17:40] <kushal> the default is known as origin
[18:18:18] <J_Caselles> !
[18:18:23] <kushal> J_Caselles, ask
[18:18:32] <anurag> !
[18:18:39] <kushal> anurag, ask
[18:18:40] <J_Caselles> sorry, which is the remote, repo01
[18:18:49] <kushal> J_Caselles, yes
[18:19:03] <kushal> J_Caselles, name of that remote is origin
[18:19:10] <J_Caselles> oh, now I understand the output of remote -v :D
[18:19:16] <anurag> both are set as origin
[18:19:52] <kushal> anurag, yes, one is for fetch and one for push, generally they are same
[18:20:09] <J_Caselles> name <namerepocloned>/.../<remoterepo>, corrent?
[18:20:12] <kushal> fetch to get from the remote, push to send back
[18:20:17] <kushal> J_Caselles, yes
[18:20:23] <kushal> try this
[18:20:25] <J_Caselles> thanks <eof>
[18:20:31] <anurag> <eof> ok
[18:20:34] <kushal> $ git pull
[18:20:45] <kushal> It should say "Already up-to-date."
[18:20:54] <kushal> as we never made any changes to repo01
[18:21:18] <kushal> let us go back to repo01
[18:21:27] <kushal> $ cd ../repo01/
[18:22:35] <kushal> now create a new file there ,
[18:22:50] <kushal> README.txt
[18:22:55] <kushal> inside
[18:23:16] <kushal> write
[18:23:29] <kushal> This is a test README file.
[18:23:37] <kushal> do it^^^
[18:23:48] <kushal> save and exit
[18:24:19] rahulch_ is now known as rahulch
[18:25:26] <kushal> $ git add README.txt
[18:25:31] <kushal> $ git commit -m "Adds a README file"
[18:25:57] <kushal> ^^ tell me when you are done
[18:26:07] <amresh> done
[18:26:13] <tenstormavi> done
[18:26:16] <elita15> done
[18:26:17] <supriya> done
[18:26:21] <tutum> done
[18:26:22] <J_Caselles> done
[18:26:24] <anisha23> done
[18:26:24] <ravi_pro> done
[18:26:25] <anwesha> done
[18:26:26] <rahulch> done

[18:26:47] <prikotiyal> done
[18:26:49] <shalini> done
[18:26:59] <satarupa> done
[18:27:03] <pankhu> done
[18:27:09] <anurag> done
[18:27:30] <kushal> now one think this as an upstream change, image if the person from whom you cloned your repo made some changes like this
[18:27:52] Ritu_ is now known as dell_
[18:27:53] <kushal> s/image/imagine/
[18:27:54] <batul> What kushal meant to say was: now one think this as an upstream change, imagine if the person from whom you cloned your repo made some changes like this
[18:27:56] <dell_> done
[18:28:02] <korak> done
[18:28:39] <kushal> so this change will not show up in your cloned repo automatically
[18:28:53] <kushal> let us first check that
[18:29:20] <kushal> let us go to clonedrepo1
[18:29:29] <kushal> $ cd ../clonedrepo1/
[18:29:39] <kushal> check the directory name carefully
[18:29:43] <kushal> git log
[18:30:42] <kushal> should be clonedrepo01
[18:31:48] <kushal> now you can see this does not have the remote changes
[18:32:31] <kushal> you can pull these changes down to your cloned repo
[18:33:21] <kushal> $ git pull
[18:33:39] <kushal> this above command will pull all changes from the origin
[18:33:56] <kushal> $ git pull

[18:34:11] <kushal>  create mode 100644 README.txt
[18:34:13] <kushal> you can try to do a git log now
[18:34:42] <kushal> tell me if you have any confusion here
[18:34:48] <tenstormavi> no
[18:35:11] <elita15> !
[18:35:38] <kushal> elita15, ask
[18:35:52] <rahulch> !
[18:36:15] <kushal> rahulch, ask
[18:36:26] <elita15> i got aldready up to date
[18:36:35] <rahulch> in the output, what is the meaning of "Fast-forward"?
[18:36:57] <kushal> rahulch, you will learn it slowly :D
[18:37:01] <kushal> rahulch, no hurry
[18:37:10] <rahulch> kushal, okay :)
[18:37:29] <kushal> elita15, have you committed those changes in repo01
[18:37:52] <kushal> ?
[18:38:01] <elita15> no
[18:38:02] <kushal> anyone else any problem
[18:38:06] <kushal> elita15, then ?
[18:38:38] <kushal> elita15, if you do not follow the steps, none of these things will work
[18:38:46] <kushal> next
[18:39:37] <kushal> you want to know the changes made in the 2nd commit from the first ever commit
[18:39:55] <kushal> $ git show commit_hash
[18:40:13] <kushal> use the commit hash you want learn about
[18:40:50] <anurag> !
[18:41:05] <tenstormavi> !
[18:41:10] <rahulch> !
[18:41:15] <kushal> anurag, tenstormavi rahulch ask
[18:41:21] <tenstormavi> fatal: ambiguous argument 'commit_hash': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
[18:41:21] <tenstormavi> Use '--' to separate paths from revisions, like this:
[18:41:22] <tenstormavi> 'git <command> [<revision>...] -- [<file>...]'
[18:41:28] <tenstormavi> i got this
[18:41:37] <kushal> tenstormavi, use fpaste to show error
[18:41:44] <rahulch> kushal, http://fpaste.org/21753/44436713/
[18:41:45] <anurag> from which directory we will enter that
[18:41:46] <anurag> ?
[18:41:48] <tenstormavi> kushal, sorry
[18:42:04] <kushal> anurag, clonedrepo01
[18:42:13] <tenstormavi> kushal, solution?
[18:43:15] <kushal> tenstormavi, rahulch you have to give a valid hash
[18:43:24] <kushal> get it from git log command
[18:43:28] <kushal> like example
[18:43:51] <kushal> in my repo
[18:43:52] <kushal> $ git show bf5c05b676a540bab3e31616ceef200676e84500
[18:45:00] <kushal> try with other log hashes

[18:52:58] <kushal> $ git commit
[18:53:10] <amresh> !

[18:57:54] <rahulch> what is this file that just opened on vim after "git commit"?
[18:57:55] <tenstormavi> kushal, http://paste.fedoraproject.org/21764/24453331/
[18:58:07] <tenstormavi> kushal, is this all right?
[18:58:10] <kushal> rahulch, that is a temporary file created by git
[18:58:25] <rahulch> and its purpose?
[18:58:51] <kushal> tenstormavi, yes, but we went ahead made more changes
[18:59:01] <kushal> tenstormavi, see what I asked to do
[18:59:19] <amresh> ok its vi not vim on my system, got it working by changing the config of git
[18:59:21] <kushal> rahulch, to have a bigger commit message
[18:59:44] <kushal> siddhant, also you are using root account
[18:59:45] <rahulch> kushal, okay.
[18:59:47] <kushal> which is bad
[19:00:32] <siddhant> kushal,so what i have to use?
[19:00:32] <kushal> and now we can push this to remote
[19:00:39] <kushal> siddhant, a normal user
[19:00:43] <kushal> non root user
[19:00:48] <kushal> siddhant, install vim for now
[19:00:53] <siddhant> kushal,ok
[19:00:58] <kushal> $ git push
[19:01:25] <kushal> ^^ the above command will push the changes to the repo, default is origin
[19:01:30] <supriya> http://paste.fedoraproject.org/21768/45550137/
[19:01:32] <supriya> is it ok?

[19:26:04] <kushal> go read it
[19:26:56] <kushal> in git branches are named pointers to commits
[19:27:05] <kushal> default branch is master
[19:27:11] <kushal> $ git branch

[19:27:26] <kushal> anurag, ask
[19:27:33] <anurag> directory ?
[19:28:06] <kushal> anurag, clonedrepo01
[19:29:23] <kushal> now we can create a branch from master
[19:29:39] Ritu_ is now known as dell_
[19:30:02] <kushal> $ git branch newbranch
[19:30:14] <kushal> this will create a branch named new branch
[19:30:22] <kushal> and then $ git checkout newbranch
[19:30:32] <kushal> will go to newbranch
[19:30:44] <kushal> for now it is same of master
[19:31:14] <kushal> you can use git branch command to see in which branch you are in
[19:31:32] <kushal> it will show with the star
[19:31:56] <rahulch> !
[19:32:06] <kushal> rahulch, ask

[19:49:26] <kushal> $ (newbranch) git add names.txt
[19:49:33] <kushal> $ (newbranch) git commit -m "Adds dgplug to the list."
[19:50:11] <kushal> do a git log
[19:50:36] <kushal> and then go back to the master branch
[19:51:28] <kushal> if you do git log there
[19:51:40] <kushal> you will not see the change we made few minutes back

[19:53:44] <zishan> yes
[19:53:44] <dell_> yes
[19:53:48] <kushal> siddhant, shantanu what is your problem ?
[19:53:49] <iam_sudip> Yes.
[19:53:52] <siddhant> i am getting the same error message
[19:53:56] <anwesha> yes
[19:54:04] <purva> yes
[19:54:05] <prikotiyal> yes
[19:54:16] <siddhant> [root@siddhant] cloned_repo01 $ (master) git checkout newbranch
[19:54:16] <siddhant> fatal: This operation must be run in a work tree
[19:54:19] <kushal> siddhant, for you, you have to start cleanly from begining
[19:54:27] <siddhant> kushal,ok
[19:54:39] <kushal> now branches are very important
[19:54:53] <kushal> in any project master is the stable branch
[19:55:01] <kushal> means things which are in master works
[19:55:11] <shantanu> kushal, http://paste.fedoraproject.org/21805/
[19:55:20] <kushal> people do make development work in another branch, say development
[19:55:54] <kushal> and for each different kind of change, they create a new branch and go; there , make changes, commit, come back to development branch
[19:56:03] <kushal> and then merge the other branch
[19:56:19] <kushal> in our case we will merge the newbranch into; master branch
[19:56:34] <kushal> so that we can get the changes made in newbrach into; master branch
[19:56:39] <kushal> to do;so
[19:57:16] <shantanu> kushal, sorry, got it
[19:57:25] <kushal> shantanu, ok
[19:57:54] <kushal>  $ (master) git merge newbranch
[19:57:55] <kushal> Updating 74b6979..32bff0b
[19:57:55] <kushal> Fast-forward
[19:57:55] <kushal>  names.txt | 1 +
[19:57:55] <kushal>  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
[19:58:31] <kushal> so the generic command is $ git merge branchname
[19:58:44] <kushal> branchname is the branch you want merge
[19:58:50] <kushal> always remember
[19:59:28] <kushal> please do any development work in a separate git branch
[19:59:31] <kushal> any questions ?
[20:00:01] <anurag> !
[20:00:11] <kushal> anurag, ask
[20:00:20] <J_Caselles> I would point out the merging has to be done when on master
[20:00:32] <kushal> J_Caselles, yes :)
