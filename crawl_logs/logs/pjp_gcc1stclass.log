Jun 29 22:55:56 <_pjp_>	ecntrk1: susenj?
Jun 29 22:56:03 <ecntrk1>	but first, don't we need to install gcc? I don't have it installed in my distro..
Jun 29 22:56:08 <susenj>	i tried cc in place of gcc ,it's okay!but when i typed man cc,shows no manual entry for cc

Jun 29 22:56:50 <Soumya>	done _pjp_
Jun 29 22:56:53 <_pjp_>	susenj: cc is a symbolic link to gcc
Jun 29 22:57:05 <ria>	ya arpita
Jun 29 22:57:13 <arpita>	ria, o.k
Jun 29 22:57:15 <_pjp_>	susenj: do you know about symbolic link?
Jun 29 22:57:21 <susenj>	is it not a command?<eof>
Jun 29 22:57:21 <kushal>	all others STOP TALKING 
Jun 29 22:57:25 <techno_freak>	arpita, no, do ls and check if you have a.out
Jun 29 22:57:37 <kushal>	STOP TALKING 
Jun 29 22:57:43 <susenj>	no,please let me know<eof>
Jun 29 22:57:51 <_pjp_>	If you did not see any errors, you should see a file called a.out
Jun 29 22:58:00 <_pjp_>	is it there?
Jun 29 22:58:11 <ria>	yup
Jun 29 22:58:19 <arpita>	_pjp_, yes a.out is there
Jun 29 22:58:49 >techno_freak<	that was for the students 
Jun 29 22:58:50 <_pjp_>	susenj: symbolic link is like a desktop shortcut in Windows.
Jun 29 22:59:14 <_pjp_>	if you see the file a.out, on the shell prompt say $ ./a.out
Jun 29 22:59:15 <susenj>	oh,i see,thanks!<eof>
Jun 29 22:59:50 <_pjp_>	that should display the greeting "Hello, world\n"

Jun 29 23:01:24 <deepak>	_pjp_:!
Jun 29 23:01:26 <_pjp_>	a.out is the earliest executable file format, and the name is the gift of Unix legacy.
Jun 29 23:01:48 <_pjp_>	though the executable file format today in Linux is far different.
Jun 29 23:01:51 <_pjp_>	see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.out
Jun 29 23:03:32 *	techno_freak has quit ("Leaving")
Jun 29 23:04:39 <_pjp_>	Now when you said $ gcc hello.c, it took four steps for gcc to actually generate the executable/binary file a.out.
Jun 29 23:05:19 <_pjp_>	fours steps are: Preprocessing, Compilation, Assembly, and lastly Code generation.

Jun 29 23:06:52 <kushal>	guys all please
Jun 29 23:07:10 <kushal>	USE http://rffb.net/paste for showing any code or error
Jun 29 23:07:11 <_pjp_>	roni: did you copy file from Windows to Linux?
Jun 29 23:07:18 <kushal>	roni, see written in english 
Jun 29 23:07:27 <deepak>	_pjp_:tell me the option i can use with gcc to name the file i wish
Jun 29 23:07:46 <_pjp_>	deepak: you mean instead of a.out?
Jun 29 23:08:11 <Soumya>	kushal, the link is http://rafb.net/paste
Jun 29 23:08:16 <deepak>	_pjp_:yes
Jun 29 23:08:22 <kushal>	Soumya, correct , my typo 
Jun 29 23:08:45 <kushal>	deepak, use ! to ask permission for speaking 
Jun 29 23:08:55 <_pjp_>	Okay, to name the executable file say: $ gcc -o <file-name> hello.c
Jun 29 23:09:08 *	mobilesuit (n=freedom@59.93.217.29) has joined #dgplug
Jun 29 23:09:16 <_pjp_>	Or $ cc -o <file-name> hello.c
Jun 29 23:09:35 *	kushal gives channel operator status to _pjp_
Jun 29 23:09:53 *	mobilesuit is away: 
Jun 29 23:09:53 <_pjp_>	the -o option of gcc/cc lets you specify the output file-name.
Jun 29 23:10:05 <_pjp_>	see gcc --help | more for more options.
Jun 29 23:10:30 <deepak>	_pjp_:ok thanks
Jun 29 23:10:45 <_pjp_>	You can actually see the output of every step mentioned earlier.
Jun 29 23:10:54 <rtnpro>	!
Jun 29 23:11:02 <_pjp_>	rtnpro: ?
Jun 29 23:11:15 <rtnpro>	whats cc -o?
Jun 29 23:11:15 *	ecntrk1 has quit ()
Jun 29 23:11:51 <_pjp_>	cc is symbolic link/shorcut to gcc, it works the same way.
Jun 29 23:12:06 <rtnpro>	!
Jun 29 23:12:23 <rtnpro>	means in place of gcc...can I use cc?
Jun 29 23:12:31 <deepak>	_pjp_:!
Jun 29 23:12:46 <_pjp_>	the earliest Unix compiler was called cc, for C Compiler
Jun 29 23:12:50 <_pjp_>	rtnpro: yes
Jun 29 23:13:02 <rtnpro>	ok
Jun 29 23:13:04 <_pjp_>	and the GNU version of cc was called gcc.
Jun 29 23:13:38 <kushal>	_pjp_, please carry on 
Jun 29 23:13:38 <_pjp_>	I hope all are aware of GNU
Jun 29 23:13:50 <kushal>	we will take questions later 
Jun 29 23:13:54 <_pjp_>	kushal: yes.
Jun 29 23:13:55 <rtnpro>	ok <eof>
Jun 29 23:14:47 <_pjp_>	So far, everybody with me?
Jun 29 23:14:53 <Prakhar>	yes
Jun 29 23:15:14 <ria>	yup

Jun 29 23:16:53 <_pjp_>	Now let's see how to generate a.out in two steps
Jun 29 23:17:41 <_pjp_>	please type: gcc -c hello.c
Jun 29 23:17:47 <_pjp_>	or cc -c hello.c
Jun 29 23:18:31 <_pjp_>	the option `-c' stops just after compilation, that is after creating the object code.
Jun 29 23:18:57 <_pjp_>	that means, preprocessing->compilation
Jun 29 23:19:20 <nandy_lost>	!
Jun 29 23:19:29 <_pjp_>	what remains is linking->executable_code_generation
Jun 29 23:19:32 <_pjp_>	nandy_lost: ?
Jun 29 23:19:48 <nandy_lost>	after compiling file name is hel.o
Jun 29 23:19:49 *	debayan has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))

Jun 29 23:21:17 <nandy_lost>	<eof>
Jun 29 23:21:19 <_pjp_>	nandy_lost: file-name remains same, except extension changes to .o
Jun 29 23:21:38 <kushal>	nandy_lost, please ask questions later 
Jun 29 23:21:48 <susenj>	it gives some garbage with  "hello world!" in the end,when i typed cat hello.o
Jun 29 23:21:51 <_pjp_>	nandy_lost: not executable really, but it's in binary format.
Jun 29 23:22:37 <Prakhar>	please move forward
Jun 29 23:22:48 <atanubera>	So todays topic is C programming in gcc compiler
Jun 29 23:23:15 <atanubera>	I am following the process
Jun 29 23:23:27 <Prakhar>	i don't think you need to re-iterate the topic
Jun 29 23:23:37 <_pjp_>	susenj: right, the garbage is actually the information used by the gcc.

Jun 29 23:49:49 *	Soumya supports Subhodip 's idea
Jun 29 23:50:22 <Soumya>	what do you mean by that t4num0y_cs3
Jun 29 23:50:24 <arpita>	Soumya, m=no error is showing on giving gcc -c but a.out file is not created
Jun 29 23:50:40 <Soumya>	you gave gcc -c (which creates a object file only ) so you got a object file
Jun 29 23:50:46 <t4num0y_cs3>	cc hello.c gives you a obj file that is a.out ...
Jun 29 23:50:47 <kushal>	arpita, yes, but hello.o 
Jun 29 23:50:48 <kushal>	see
Jun 29 23:50:50 <Prakhar>	a.out file is the final output file
Jun 29 23:50:59 <Soumya>	yes arpita it will not create a.out
Jun 29 23:51:01 <t4num0y_cs3>	but cc -c hello.c .. where is a.out ?
Jun 29 23:51:08 <kushal>	t4num0y_cs3, no a.out 
Jun 29 23:51:12 <Soumya>	it will create yourfilename.o file (means object file)
Jun 29 23:51:13 <kushal>	that is what he is teaching 
Jun 29 23:51:14 <deepak>	kushal:yes hello.o only has created
Jun 29 23:51:26 <arpita>	Soumya, so now to execute it what to do?
Jun 29 23:51:34 <Soumya>	let _pjp_ come
Jun 29 23:51:37 <Prakhar>	wait
Jun 29 23:51:42 <Soumya>	he will tell you the details
Jun 29 23:51:50 <Soumya>	arpita, wait till here till _pjp_ comes

Jun 29 23:53:12 <susenj>	try this
Jun 29 23:53:13 <ria>	kushal, you say me why gcc -c works but not gcc -o
Jun 29 23:53:24 <ria>	kushal, gcc -o gives errors
Jun 29 23:53:28 <kushal>	ria, yes
Jun 29 23:53:36 <ria>	kushal, why?
Jun 29 23:53:40 <kushal>	_pjp_, was telling in two steps
Jun 29 23:53:46 <kushal>	first step is gcc -c 
Jun 29 23:53:51 <Soumya>	please you people make it (no .out file is created) the last command created a object file .o (You cant execute .o file)
Jun 29 23:54:04 <ria>	kushal, ok
Jun 29 23:54:30 <Soumya>	_pjp_, is teaching to make it in two steps

Jun 30 00:33:53 <_pjp_1>	say: gcc -x c hello.c
Jun 30 00:34:16 <_pjp_1>	or copy hello.c to hello.txt and say: gcc -x c hello.txt
Jun 30 00:34:30 <_pjp_1>	you should get the same a.out file.
Jun 30 00:35:03 <_pjp_1>	this comes handy when a project includes both, C and C++ source files.
Jun 30 00:35:23 *	chacha_chaudhry has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
Jun 30 00:35:43 <_pjp_1>	other one is -std to specify the language standard.
Jun 30 00:36:11 <arpita>	gcc -x c hjello.c is not working
Jun 30 00:36:16 <_pjp_1>	C language has more than one published standard so far.
Jun 30 00:36:35 <_pjp_1>	arpita: what happens?
Jun 30 00:37:13 <_pjp_1>	standard C89 is the most widely used and supported standard todate.
Jun 30 00:37:35 <deepak>	!
Jun 30 00:37:47 <t4num0y_cs3>	!
Jun 30 00:38:32 <arpita>	 _pjp_1 ,In function `main':hello.c:: undefined reference to `sqrt returned 1 exit status is the error showing
Jun 30 00:38:46 <_pjp_1>	All C compilers comply with the C89 standard.
Jun 30 00:39:02 <_pjp_1>	arpita: you did not link with -lm
Jun 30 00:39:14 <_pjp_1>	deepak: t4num0y_cs3: ?
Jun 30 00:39:49 <deepak>	[deepak@localhost ~]$ cp hello1.c hello1.txt
Jun 30 00:40:04 <deepak>	i used this as first
Jun 30 00:40:10 <t4num0y_cs3>	same permission denied error ..
Jun 30 00:40:19 <deepak>	my file name is hello1.c
Jun 30 00:40:20 <_pjp_1>	there is also C99 standard, but not all compilers support this, and thus still not portable enough.
Jun 30 00:40:53 <_pjp_1>	t4num0y_cs3: what did you do?
Jun 30 00:40:53 <deepak>	[deepak@localhost ~]$ gcc -x c hello1.txt
Jun 30 00:41:50 <kushal>	deepak, link it with -lm
Jun 30 00:42:16 <deepak>	kushal:now it is ok
Jun 30 00:42:21 <t4num0y_cs3>	$ cc -c hello.c
Jun 30 00:42:23 <t4num0y_cs3>	$ cc -lm hello.c
Jun 30 00:42:36 <Soumya>	_pjp_1, can we directly do gcc -x hello.txt
Jun 30 00:42:39 <t4num0y_cs3>	also $ cc -lm hello.o
Jun 30 00:42:41 <Soumya>	to get a.out ??
Jun 30 00:43:07 <t4num0y_cs3>	no i got hello.o
Jun 30 00:43:10 <_pjp_1>	Soumya: no, -x option asks for source language, and hello.txt is a file-name.
Jun 30 00:44:23 <Soumya>	ok so let any program be in hello.txt we should do gcc -x c hello.txt
Jun 30 00:44:35 <Soumya>	right _pjp_1 ?
Jun 30 00:44:57 <ria>	!
Jun 30 00:45:17 <_pjp_1>	Soumya: not always -x c
Jun 30 00:45:20 <_pjp_1>	ria: ?
Jun 30 00:45:39 <Soumya>	then _pjp_1 ?
Jun 30 00:45:43 <t4num0y_cs3>	_pjp_1 , ?
Jun 30 00:45:46 <ria>	if it combines 2 languages then will it be like gcc -x c c++ <filename> ?
Jun 30 00:46:12 <ria>	is the c for the c language?
Jun 30 00:46:16 <ria>	<eof>
Jun 30 00:46:20 <_pjp_1>	Soumya: I mean, specify the language of the program that is in hello.txt
Jun 30 00:46:45 <_pjp_1>	ria: c++ compiler understands C code, so you can just say -x c++
Jun 30 00:47:20 <Soumya>	ok
Jun 30 00:47:24 <ria>	ok
Jun 30 00:47:30 *	chacha_chaudhry_ is now known as chacha_chaudhry
Jun 30 00:47:39 <ria>	_pjp_1, when there are 2 languages then?
Jun 30 00:47:49 <ria>	other than c and c++?
Jun 30 00:48:02 <ria>	can we use gcc +x?
Jun 30 00:48:14 <_pjp_1>	ria: gcc +x?
Jun 30 00:48:26 <ria>	sorry gcc -x
Jun 30 00:48:56 <_pjp_1>	ï»¿folks there are other useful options like -I -L and -D etc. May be we'll talk about them tomorrow.
Jun 30 00:49:11 <_pjp_1>	for now let's take the questions.
Jun 30 00:49:15 <_pjp_1>	kushal: okay?
Jun 30 00:49:39 <_pjp_1>	ria: two languages in one file?
Jun 30 00:50:09 <ria>	no you were talking of combining 2 languages that's why _pjp_1
Jun 30 00:50:15 <kushal>	_pjp_1, perfect 
Jun 30 00:50:27 <t4num0y_cs3>	!
Jun 30 00:50:31 <ria>	ya its not possible to have to languages in a file
Jun 30 00:50:44 <_pjp_1>	okay guys..let's hit the questions. :)
Jun 30 00:50:46 <_pjp_1>	t4num0y_cs3: ?
Jun 30 00:50:59 <Soumya>	!
Jun 30 00:51:02 <_pjp_1>	Soumya: ?
Jun 30 00:51:04 <t4num0y_cs3>	What about this Permission ? what i have to do ?
Jun 30 00:51:21 <_pjp_1>	t4num0y_cs3: I'm sorry, but I don't know what you are doing?
Jun 30 00:51:43 <Soumya>	_pjp_1, what you told in gcc -x c hello.txt was we should specify the language !!
Jun 30 00:52:02 <Soumya>	can you specify by some example and all so that i can get completely
Jun 30 00:52:13 <Soumya>	i have got you , but i need one example
Jun 30 00:52:26 <kushal>	t4num0y_cs3, please type the steps in rafb and give us the link
Jun 30 00:52:34 <kushal>	Soumya, like
Jun 30 00:52:43 <kushal>	there is a file called kus.txt
Jun 30 00:52:58 <kushal>	if inside it C code is there  
Jun 30 00:53:01 <kushal>	then 
Jun 30 00:53:10 <kushal>	gcc -x c kus.txt 
Jun 30 00:53:14 <kushal>	if C++ 
Jun 30 00:53:19 <kushal>	gcc -x c++  kus.txt 
Jun 30 00:53:25 <_pjp_1>	Soumya: the program in hello.txt is written in C, so you say -x c
Jun 30 00:53:37 <kushal>	anyone , any other question ?
Jun 30 00:53:48 <ria>	!
Jun 30 00:53:53 <kushal>	ria, yes
Jun 30 00:54:03 <ria>	why do we need to use it gcc -x?
Jun 30 00:54:05 <_pjp_1>	otherwise you could say -x c++ or -x ada or -x assembler etc.
Jun 30 00:54:10 <ria>	when is it needed
Jun 30 00:54:17 <ria>	?
Jun 30 00:54:24 <ria>	<eof>
Jun 30 00:54:32 <_pjp_1>	ria: it's not always necessary, but sometimes useful.
Jun 30 00:54:34 <arpita>	!
Jun 30 00:54:34 <kushal>	ria, like in a project you wrote files in C and C++ also (different files)
Jun 30 00:54:50 <kushal>	ria, so then compiling each you can specify which language 
Jun 30 00:54:53 <kushal>	arpita, yes 
Jun 30 00:55:02 <ria>	kushal, are there 2 files one with c and other c++?
Jun 30 00:55:13 <_pjp_1>	Soumya: ?
Jun 30 00:55:28 <kushal>	ria, yes, (example )
Jun 30 00:55:38 <ria>	ok kushal
Jun 30 00:55:41 <Soumya>	got it _pjp_1 , thank you
Jun 30 00:55:50 <kushal>	t4num0y_cs3, there ?
Jun 30 00:55:51 <arpita>	Kishan, gcc -x c hello.c is not working
Jun 30 00:56:02 <ria>	everything clear :)
Jun 30 00:56:02 <kushal>	arpita, no, see the error

Jun 30 00:57:41 <arpita>	Kishan, o.k
Jun 30 00:57:45 <arpita>	kushal, o.k
Jun 30 00:57:48 <kushal>	arpita, see at the beginning of the class you got this error 
Jun 30 00:57:49 <ria>	arpita, use gcc -c -x
Jun 30 00:57:59 <ria>	arpita, it will work then
Jun 30 00:57:59 <kushal>	arpita, ^^ 
Jun 30 00:58:50 <kushal>	a, who are you ?
Jun 30 00:59:01 <t4num0y_cs3>	_pjp_1 , then which one is executable file ? i mean how can i run it ?
Jun 30 00:59:02 <ria>	kushal, will the link be done in the same way after using gcc -c -x?
Jun 30 00:59:10 <kushal>	ria, yes, correct 
Jun 30 00:59:19 <kushal>	ria, gcc hello.o -lm
Jun 30 00:59:37 <ria>	ya ok kushal
Jun 30 00:59:48 <t4num0y_cs3>	kushal , http://rafb.net/p/FXMuZZ70.html

Jun 30 01:00:09 <kushal>	t4num0y_cs3, run ./a.out 
Jun 30 01:00:27 <kushal>	t4num0y_cs3, gcc hello.o -lm will create a.out as executable 
Jun 30 01:01:07 <amrita>	kushal, previously when we did the hello world programme we used a single command to execute and it worked but in sqrt case it is not why?
Jun 30 01:01:28 <kushal>	amrita, because _pjp_1 mentioned to do the same in two steps
Jun 30 01:01:37 <kushal>	amrita, scroll back and read 
Jun 30 01:01:50 <amrita>	kushal, yes that's ok
Jun 30 01:02:05 <kushal>	:)
Jun 30 01:02:10 <kushal>	any other question 
Jun 30 01:02:36 <amrita>	kushal, but if  i want to do in single command should it work?
Jun 30 01:02:44 <kushal>	amrita, yes
Jun 30 01:02:53 <deepak>	no every thing clear
