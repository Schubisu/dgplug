Jun 28 22:58:12 <kushal>	an editor is a software which help you to edit some file 
Jun 28 22:58:22 <kushal>	now there are different kinds of editor 
Jun 28 22:58:34 <kushal>	some for text, some for audio, some for video 
Jun 28 22:59:23 <kushal>	Now, the one we are going to discuss about is Vi (actually vim ) and other good one is emacs 
Jun 28 22:59:41 <kushal>	we will discuss about vim which is newer version of vi 
Jun 28 22:59:45 <kushal>	Vi imroved 
Jun 28 22:59:50 <kushal>	* improved
Jun 28 23:00:10 <kushal>	Now, whoever is on Fedora, vi is an alias to vim 
Jun 28 23:00:18 <mobilesuit>	!

Jun 28 23:00:33 <kushal>	mobilesuit, yes
Jun 28 23:00:56 <mobilesuit>	on fedora, will vi-minimal package suffice ?
