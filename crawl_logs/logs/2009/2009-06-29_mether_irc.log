Jun 29 19:06:57 <mether>	I guess i can get started then
Jun 29 19:06:58 <kushal>	Meejan, stage is yours , go ahead
Jun 29 19:07:10 <mether>	kushal, --
Jun 29 19:07:24 <spechard>	kushal: StÃ©phane PÃ©chard
Jun 29 19:07:24 <kushal>	oops
Jun 29 19:07:25 <mether>	see, that is a common mistake one could avoid
Jun 29 19:07:54 *	kopecks (n=koyel@117.201.100.56) has joined #dgplug
Jun 29 19:08:25 <mether>	So this session isn't about the technical details ( irssi vs xchat or whatever) but the social context of IRC in free software development and feedback
Jun 29 19:08:27 *	aunkit (n=ankit@117.197.57.66) has joined #dgplug
Jun 29 19:08:44 *	aunkit (n=ankit@117.197.57.66) has left #dgplug
Jun 29 19:09:36 <mether>	IRC rooms such as this one provides a place for free software development discussions and Q&A to happen in real time
Jun 29 19:10:11 <mether>	This is important for all of us since most of the development happens via the Internet and we need to ask and answer questions
Jun 29 19:10:35 <mether>	However, people's time and attention is a scarce resource and it would be advisable to use it wisely
Jun 29 19:11:22 <mether>	It is possible to track down many key developers in various important projects and ask them questions directly and such transparency is powerful but people are generally busy and before doing so, do your own research
Jun 29 19:12:38 <mether>	A common problem I see often in IRC channels (and other forums) especially from people new to Linux in India is a formal tone
Jun 29 19:12:44 *	parthachowdhury has quit ("WeeChat 0.2.6.3")
Jun 29 19:13:21 <mether>	Students who are trained to  be polite and show respect often tend to assume that they should do so in IRC channels and mailing lists as well
Jun 29 19:13:41 <mether>	This is often quite strange thing for other people and some might consider it even offensive
Jun 29 19:14:16 *	parthachowdhury (n=parthach@59.93.209.222) has joined #dgplug
Jun 29 19:14:23 <mether>	"Respected people of the Internet, May I ask a question here humbly in your LUG channel" isn't necessary
Jun 29 19:14:34 <mether>	Just ask the question
Jun 29 19:15:05 <mether>	Another annoyance is people who ask to ask (ie) Can I ask a question? or another variant, which is, Is anybody here using Linux?
Jun 29 19:15:36 <no_mind>	Vivek Khurana :)
Jun 29 19:16:01 <mether>	You don't need permission. Just describe the problem briefly, stick to the technical details, what you tried to do to solve the issue and provide any error messages specifically
Jun 29 19:16:17 <mether>	"Foo doesn't work" is completely meaningless
Jun 29 19:16:21 *	mageshcse (n=mahesh@122.174.120.177) has joined #dgplug
Jun 29 19:16:25 *	kishan_ (n=kishan@117.99.46.38) has joined #dgplug
Jun 29 19:17:01 <mether>	"When I restart, I get a message, evdev loops. system struck" is more meaningful
Jun 29 19:17:15 <mether>	Another common mistake, is to get on a channel
Jun 29 19:17:16 *	mageshcse just joined dgplug
Jun 29 19:17:28 <mether>	and start asking personal questions about people in the room
Jun 29 19:17:41 <mether>	who are you, where are you from etc
Jun 29 19:17:59 <mether>	save such social banter for people who are somewhat familiar with
Jun 29 19:18:45 <mether>	Internet provides some amount of anonymity and many people value their privacy. They don't need to tell you their age, sex, location. This is not a yahoo chat room
Jun 29 19:19:10 *	sunny_slls (n=sunny@125.20.11.34) has joined #dgplug
Jun 29 19:19:19 *	mageshcse waves hi to everyone 
Jun 29 19:19:22 <mether>	yet another common mistake is to ask a question in the room
Jun 29 19:19:34 <mether>	and when you get an answer, PM the person for more details or more questions
Jun 29 19:19:43 >mageshcse,<	a session is going on 
Jun 29 19:19:45 <mether>	this is intrusive and irritating
Jun 29 19:19:57 *	priya has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
Jun 29 19:20:06 <mether>	when you get a answer in the room, you are expected to continue with discussions in the public room itself
Jun 29 19:20:28 *	zer0c00l_ (n=zer0c00l@117.199.134.7) has joined #dgplug
Jun 29 19:20:34 <mether>	this is important for various other reasons - people learn from each other, it provides a chance for anyone interested to answer your questions etc
Jun 29 19:21:14 <mether>	The various rooms defer on the amount of things they tolerate
Jun 29 19:21:27 <mether>	for example, in some rooms, it is ok to paste quite a bit of content directly in the channel
Jun 29 19:21:42 <mether>	others require you to use a site like pastebin.net
Jun 29 19:21:58 <mether>	the first thing you should do while getting into a new irc channel
Jun 29 19:22:05 <mether>	is OBSERVE what is happening
Jun 29 19:22:10 *	zer0c00l has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
Jun 29 19:22:20 <mether>	read the topic of the channel. /topic for those new to IRC
Jun 29 19:22:37 <mether>	once you observe for sometime
Jun 29 19:23:00 *	yevlempy (i=yevlempy@121.245.27.140) has joined #dgplug
Jun 29 19:23:06 <mether>	feel free to help out. Others will reciprocate when it is more evident you are willing to do your part
Jun 29 19:23:19 <anki1>	!
Jun 29 19:23:24 <mether>	anki1, ask
Jun 29 19:23:44 <anki1>	if my question is not answered then what to do
Jun 29 19:24:18 <anki1>	many irc's dont allow to post questions more than once
Jun 29 19:24:29 <mether>	good question
Jun 29 19:24:53 <mether>	there is a social norm even if it isn't a rigid rule about how long one must wait before repeating the things if at all
Jun 29 19:25:00 <mether>	in some channels, it is simply not allowed
Jun 29 19:25:18 <mether>	but in most cases, I have seen, it is ok, as long as you don't mindlessly repeat it every few seconds
Jun 29 19:25:30 <mether>	what is important here is to understand the perspective of others
Jun 29 19:25:40 <mether>	if you keep repeating it, it shows a few things
Jun 29 19:25:48 <mether>	1) you are impatient
Jun 29 19:25:56 <mether>	2) you expect others to provide answers immediately
Jun 29 19:26:17 <mether>	3) you don't do enough research
Jun 29 19:26:30 <mether>	wait for a few mins
Jun 29 19:26:34 <mether>	provide more details if you can
Jun 29 19:26:43 <mether>	go look for other venues
Jun 29 19:27:04 <mether>	remember that a single irc channel isn't usually the only option available
Jun 29 19:27:25 <mether>	if it is a small project, it is extremely common to have only a half dozen people in the room
Jun 29 19:27:36 <mether>	with a single developer in a time zone different from yours
Jun 29 19:27:43 <mether>	try asking a few hours later
Jun 29 19:27:49 <mether>	or look for forums or mailing lists
Jun 29 19:28:10 <mether>	if it is a generic issue, your local lug or even your friend might be able to help you
Jun 29 19:30:46 <mether>	if it is a bug, you might try reading the project bug tracker.
Jun 29 19:32:04 <mether>	does anyone here have questions, feel free to ask

Jun 29 19:34:32 <mether>	:-)
Jun 29 19:34:50 <anki1>	yeah
Jun 29 19:34:51 <kishan__>	I am here
Jun 29 19:34:58 <kishan__>	got dc twice
Jun 29 19:34:59 <anki1>	no questions
Jun 29 19:35:00 <kushal>	questions please
Jun 29 19:35:09 <rtnpro>	me too
Jun 29 19:35:31 <mether>	somebody post up a log then and I will happily answer questions even later
Jun 29 19:35:45 <kushal>	a quick roll call then 
Jun 29 19:35:52 <kushal>	again for the students 
Jun 29 19:35:53 <mether>	PS: You cannot afford to be shy on IRC
Jun 29 19:36:02 <anki1>	Ankit Sharma
