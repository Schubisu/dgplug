[16:54.31] <mbuf> parthachowdhury: good; to answer your question, you only register your nickname with password once
[16:54.39] <mbuf> parthachowdhury: but, everytime you login, you identify yourself with the password
[16:55.08] <mbuf> and here is the documentation on how to do it: http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#nicksetup
[16:56.05] <mbuf> as we start working with projects, you can acquire the necessary skills along the way; we can work out deadlines based on that;
[16:56.36] <mbuf> if anyone has any questions, please ask, before I end the introductory session
[16:56.47] <spechard> !
[16:56.52] <mbuf> *or if anyone wants to ask any question(s)

[16:59.40] *** susenj (n=neeraj@59.177.75.103) Quit (Excess Flood)
[16:59.51] <mbuf> kopecks89: coming to your query, homework means not school/college homework
[17:00.13] <mbuf> kopecks89: it means one has to do some basic search online, or research through books or online material before asking questions
[17:00.38] <mbuf> kopecks89: it could be looking at forums, mailing list archives, or just simple use of a search engine; please read this article fully: http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#before

[17:01.41] <mbuf> we are a very informal group, which means there is nothing like teacher-student; sometimes you as a newbie might know something that you would like to share
[17:01.44] *** kopecks89 (n=koyel@117.201.98.200) has joined #dgplug
[17:01.47] <mbuf> and you are welcome to conduct sessions in this channel;
[17:02.16] <rtnpro> mbuf, !
[17:02.27] <mbuf> important thing in the community is that we value *technical competence* and not who you are, how much money you earn, or what is your designation, or how much years of experience you have;
[17:02.30] <mbuf> rtnpro: shoot!
[17:02.56] <rtnpro> mbuf, I just went through the list of projects
[17:03.10] <mbuf> you can go through the following presentation before coming to IRC on Saturday: http://shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/presentations/i-want-2-do-project-tell-me-wat-2-do-fedora.pdf
[17:03.31] <rtnpro> mbuf, about Fedora complete repository setup (offline)
[17:03.50] <rtnpro> mbuf, what we are expected to do in that
[17:03.50] <mbuf> and I don't want anyone staying late in browsing centers to attend the IRC session; you can check the archives during the day;
[17:04.36] <mbuf> rtnpro: i just put some ideas there; maybe some of the solutions already exist (that I am unaware of); I need to be able to take complete Fedora repo and deploy in a school/college that does not have Internet connection
[17:04.52] <rtnpro> mbuf, I am already maintaining an offline Fedora 10 i386 repo in my HDD
[17:05.11] <mbuf> rtnpro: maybe from a USB hard-disk; and what is the size of the repo? how do you deploy it?
[17:05.37] <aveek> !
[17:05.50] <rtnpro> mbuf, its close to 25 GB, and I run it via an FTP server
[17:05.54] <parthachowdhury> !
[17:06.03] <mbuf> aveek: if you want to add something to this discussion, you can comment, but, if you have a new question, then wait;
[17:06.21] <parthachowdhury> ok
[17:06.29] <mbuf> rtnpro: have you tried it on a LAN where new installations can use it as a repo?
[17:06.47] <rtnpro> mbuf, yes
[17:06.48] <aveek> in my college i am also deploying it after reaching on 5th
[17:07.03] <zer0c00l> mbuf, i tried , i did that thing in my college
[17:07.08] <mbuf> rtnpro: aveek good; do you have an online HOWTO or some document on it?
[17:07.14] <mbuf> zer0c00l: cool
[17:07.35] <rtnpro> mbuf, I blogged about it once
[17:07.37] <aveek> pardon? document that it is to be put up?
[17:07.57] <mbuf> aveek: document or HOWTO on how to deploy it and use it;
[17:08.09] <aveek> no
[17:08.22] <mbuf> I think I need to add a column that states "Status" in the list of tasks;
[17:08.38] <mbuf> aveek: always when you complete a task, one should immediately write a quick document and upload it or blog it;
[17:08.42] <rtnpro> mbuf, I made some changes from the traditional repo style
[17:08.58] <mbuf> rtnpro: please e-mail the same HOWTO to dgplug for review;
[17:08.59] *** priti (n=priti@support.deeproot.co.in) Quit ("Leaving")
[17:09.09] <rtnpro> mbuf, ok
[17:09.11] <mbuf> rtnpro: thanks!
[17:09.15] <mbuf> aveek: you had a question?
[17:09.22] <aveek> i am yet to deploy it..just received a HDD from Rangeen some 15 days back
[17:09.31] <aveek> no ..this itself
[17:09.45] <mbuf> aveek: ok, good; I will bring my HDD when I come to Agartala and make a copy in my USB HDD;
[17:09.58] <mbuf> parthachowdhury: you had a question?
[17:10.37] *** Kkhushi (n=khushbu@59.180.143.180) Quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
[17:11.05] <parthachowdhury> i just wanted to say
[17:11.21] <parthachowdhury> it can be done with createrepo and kickstart
[17:11.42] <parthachowdhury> for a fedora repo with updates
[17:11.56] <mbuf> parthachowdhury: I don't want to create one; if someone has a complete repo snapshot, I just want to copy it and deploy it;
[17:12.34] <mbuf> parthachowdhury: not everyone is in broadband, and so, we need to be able to share the complete repos in external disks;
[17:12.56] <parthachowdhury> then a machine can be setup as a file server with cron to rsync
[17:12.59] <mbuf> updates can be obtained as servicepacks
[17:13.16] <mbuf> parthachowdhury: think of a repo that is not connected to the Internet
[17:14.12] <mbuf> parthachowdhury: people have large HDDs, so storing is not a problem;
[17:14.16] <parthachowdhury> then one has to manually add a repo file and loopmount it
[17:14.25] <rtnpro> mbuf, the offline repo can be updated on a regular basis
[17:14.33] <rtnpro> might be weekly
[17:14.34] <mbuf> parthachowdhury: rtnpro ok
[17:14.50] <mbuf> we will discuss this later;
[17:14.53] <zer0c00l> mbuf, editing  baseurl in /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora.repo
[17:14.54] <mbuf> any other questions?
[17:14.56] <rtnpro> ok
[17:14.58] <zer0c00l> will dp
[17:15.00] <zer0c00l> *do
[17:15.14] <zer0c00l> ok
[17:15.31] <mbuf> good; so we end the Introduction session now; EOF
