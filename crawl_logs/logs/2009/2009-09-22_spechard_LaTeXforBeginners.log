[15:32:07] <spechard> ========== SESSION STARTS ============
[15:32:17] <spechard> i recall, type ! when you want to talk
[15:32:42] <spechard> if you didn't already, please take the presentation of this session: http://spechard.dgplug.org/LaTeXForBeginners/LaTeXForBeginners.pdf
[15:32:51] <spechard> this is done with LaTeX :-)
[15:33:06] <spechard> you'll be able to see the code here: http://gitorious.org/latex-for-beginners/
[15:33:16] <spechard> but please don't go there now, you'll have time later
[15:33:50] <spechard> ouh, I forgot: ROLL CALL!
[15:34:04] <kishan> Kishan Goyal
[15:34:15] <zer0c00l`> Arun SAG
[15:34:18] <kopecks_> koyel banerjee
[15:34:21] <-> zer0c00l` is now known as zer0c00l
[15:34:27] <yevlempy> yevlempy: Harsh Verma
[15:34:27] <ParthaChwodhury> Partha Chwodhury
[15:35:08] <spechard> ok, that seems good
[15:35:31] <spechard> Please go to slide 2
[15:35:36] <spechard> ===========> 2
[15:35:48] <spechard> this is the outline basically
[15:36:03] <spechard> after a small intro, we're going to write our first document
[15:36:28] <spechard> then I'll go through basic stuff on maths, content management and some additionnal stuff
[15:36:34] <spechard> i'll close with some resources
[15:36:55] <spechard> i hope the session I prepared is not too long, tell me if you think I'm going too long
[15:37:03] <spechard> ==========> 3
[15:37:13] <spechard> ok, so first a bit of terminology
[15:37:32] <spechard> you may know LaTeX by name, but do you know TeX?
[15:37:37] <chandana> Chandana Boral
[15:37:37] <chandana> Chandana Boral
[15:38:02] <spechard> TeX was the first step, written by Donald Knuth in the late '70s
[15:38:06] <spechard> yes, that's old!
[15:38:25] <spechard> basically, Donald Knuth=God
[15:38:26] --> SkyRocknRoll (n=chatzill@117.193.163.35) has joined #dgplug
[15:38:32] <spechard> for coputer scientists
[15:38:39] <spechard> computer scientists
[15:38:55] <spechard> TeX is a very low-level markup and programming language
[15:39:09] <spechard> it's very powerful but very hard to handle
[15:39:20] <spechard> basically, very few people use it as it is
[15:39:40] <spechard> that is why LaTeX was created by Leslie Lamport in 1985
[15:39:51] --> gnukid (n=user@117.199.131.239) has joined #dgplug
[15:39:53] <spechard> it brings simplicity to the system, with macros
[15:40:09] <spechard> it's quite easy to use and very extendable as we'll see
[15:40:23] <spechard> just remember this, TeX != LaTeX
[15:40:31] <spechard> ===========> 4
[15:40:43] <spechard> why using LaTeX? you may ask
[15:41:33] <spechard> well, its main purpose is to separate content from form
[15:41:58] <spechard> this way, the author only thinks about content while the system applies the form
[15:42:26] <spechard> style is then consistent over the whole document
[15:42:45] <spechard> and stuff like maths are easy to be rendered
[15:43:06] <-- SkyRocknRoll (n=chatzill@117.193.163.35) has quit (Nick collision from services.)
[15:43:07] <spechard> if you ever try to write a lot of equations with MS Word, you know aht I mean
[15:43:21] --> SkyRocknRoll (n=chatzill@117.193.173.98) has joined #dgplug
[15:43:55] <spechard> that's why it is being said that LaTeX uses a "What you see is what you mean" approach
[15:44:11] <spechard> you think about the logic, the system thinks about the way it is rendered
[15:44:43] <spechard> and believe me: LaTeX is a way better typographer than me, you and any WYSIWYG system :-)
[15:44:48] <spechard> ============> 5
[15:45:02] <spechard> this is a simplified overview of how LaTeX works
[15:45:27] <spechard> we write a .tex file, that we compile through the system
[15:45:42] <spechard> it may use some additional data (actually it always does)
[15:46:09] <spechard> some internal files are generated during the compilation to store temporary data
[15:46:29] <spechard> and at the output, we get a log and the formatted output we want
[15:47:00] <spechard> here, I won't talk about .dvi files
[15:47:24] <spechard> just know that historically, LaTeX, dvi files were the results of the latex command
[15:47:37] <spechard> now, we use a pdf wrapper called pdflatex
[15:47:58] <spechard> it generates a pdf, which is usually what we want as an output
[15:48:03] <spechard> ===========> 6
[15:48:17] <spechard> ok, time to create our first document
[15:48:20] <spechard> ===========> 7
[15:48:42] <spechard> a LaTeX document is made of parts: the preamble and the body
[15:48:59] <spechard> as you see here, a commented line starst with %
[15:49:26] <spechard> the preamble begins with \ d o c u m e n t c l a s s { report }
[15:49:29] <spechard> oups
[15:49:40] <spechard> the preamble begins with \documentclass{report}
[15:49:46] <-- Shrink (n=sgupta@redhat/shrink) has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
[15:49:55] <-- SkyRocknRoll (n=chatzill@117.193.173.98) has left #dgplug
[15:50:03] <spechard> in fact, what is between brackets may vary
[15:50:28] <spechard> the body begins with \begin{document} and ends with \end{document}
[15:50:49] <spechard> a \begin{env}...\end{env} structure is called an environment
[15:51:23] <spechard> we'll see a lot of this in the following, this is a way to structure information in LateX
[15:51:33] <spechard> ===========> 8
[15:52:01] <spechard> the \documentclass command takes different options and one parameter
[15:52:14] <spechard> in LaTeX, options are usually given between [ ]
[15:52:27] <spechard> and mandatory paramters between { }
[15:52:41] <spechard> here we create a report class document
[15:53:04] <spechard> there are different classes, depending on the type of document you're writing
[15:53:18] <spechard> most common are report, article, book and letter
[15:53:44] <spechard> there is a lot of options possible for \documentclass
[15:54:31] <spechard> here I specify the font size (11pt), the paper format (a4format) and the fact that only one side of the paper is used
[15:54:40] <spechard> ===========> 9
[15:55:13] <spechard> you'll be able to find the whole list of options online or on a book
[15:55:38] <spechard> packages are LaTeX components which extend it's possibilities
[15:56:07] <spechard> this is the way to include a package \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
[15:56:28] <spechard> the package name is inputenc, it specifies the encoding of the input text
[15:56:39] <spechard> here we use utf8 encoding
[15:56:59] <spechard> here, I give some common packages
[15:57:07] <spechard> most of them will be used in the following
[15:57:24] <spechard> everyone is still there?
[15:57:48] <zer0c00l> spechard: yes
[15:58:06] <yevlempy> spechard: yup.
[15:58:14] <chandana> spechard: yes
[15:58:25] <spechard> ok, now open your favorite text editor
[15:58:37] <spechard> or, if you have it on your machine, kile
[15:58:54] <spechard> which is a kde LaTeX-specific editor
[15:59:20] <spechard> we will write a simple document called exemple.tex (you may change its name)
[15:59:38] <spechard> ===========> 10
[15:59:49] <spechard> here we find the preamble of our document
[16:00:16] <spechard> of course, you change the author, title and date as you wish :-)
[16:00:22] <spechard> this is just an exemple
[16:00:38] --> xAbhishek (n=xAbhishe@unaffiliated/xabhishek) has joined #dgplug
[16:00:59] <spechard> the important thing here is to get used to the specific syntax (all of these weird \)
[16:01:18] <spechard> tell me when your preamble is done
[16:01:52] --> susmit (n=susmit@59.93.210.123) has joined #dgplug
[16:03:28] <-- chandana (n=7c7ca2a8@67.205.60.108) has quit ("CGI:IRC (Ping timeout)")
[16:03:49] --> chandana (n=7c7ca2a8@apocalypse.dreamhost.com) has joined #dgplug
[16:04:38] <spechard> is this done?
[16:04:42] <zer0c00l> done;
[16:05:17] <kishan> done
[16:05:17] <spechard> ok, I hope you read carefully what you've written
[16:05:31] <spechard> happily, commands are very straightforward
[16:05:35] <spechard> ===========> 11
[16:05:45] <spechard> now the real document begins
[16:05:46] --> aveek (i=75fee537@gateway/web/freenode/x-hzzymkopfamqcfmm) has joined #dgplug
[16:05:51] <-- xAbhishek (n=xAbhishe@unaffiliated/xabhishek) has left #dgplug
[16:05:57] <spechard> a command to know is \maketitle
[16:06:08] <spechard> it generates the title on the first page
[16:06:34] <spechard> it takes the information you gave in the preamble
[16:06:51] <spechard> please write down your own simple document
[16:07:08] <spechard> you can take this one like it is, or modify its content
[16:07:39] <spechard> the environment abstract creates a small portion of text just below the title
[16:07:52] <spechard> as an abstract should be
[16:08:35] <spechard> I forgot to precise that this document is an article, the command \maketitle has a different effect on a report
[16:08:49] <spechard> as you see, we create two sections
[16:08:57] <spechard> with the simple command \section{}
[16:09:16] <spechard> we'll see that there is several sectionning commands
[16:09:33] <spechard> the second section includes maths
[16:09:50] <spechard> this may seem strange right now, but we'll explain it soon :-)
[16:10:01] <spechard> ===========> 12
[16:10:13] <-- ParthaChwodhury (n=partha@59.93.216.162) has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
[16:10:25] <spechard> when you finish to write down your document, you compile it with: pdflatex exemple.pdf
[16:10:47] <spechard> please do it, and tell me if you see problems
[16:11:08] <spechard> a successful compilation gives hand back at you
[16:11:29] <spechard> otherwise, latex stops and prints an error
[16:11:40] <spechard> does everyone get a pdf file ?
[16:13:22] <zer0c00l> !
[16:13:52] <zer0c00l> what is \usepackage{1modern}? 1modern is a font? what if its not available?
[16:14:25] <spechard> zer0c00l: you can remove this line usually
[16:14:47] <spechard> zer0c00l: this way, it will use an old version of Computer Modern font, the default LaTeX font
[16:15:01] <kishan> yes, got a pdf file
[16:15:03] <spechard> zer0c00l: you don't have it on your system?
[16:15:08] <spechard> kishan: great!
[16:15:22] <spechard> kishan: did you use lmodern?
[16:15:30] <zer0c00l> spechard: yes
[16:15:30] <kishan> spechard: yes
[16:15:35] <spechard> ok
[16:15:41] <spechard> zer0c00l: try without this line
[16:16:21] --> binodc (n=binodc@220.225.125.243) has joined #dgplug
[16:16:23] <zer0c00l> spechard: tired without it, and it worked fine
[16:16:33] <spechard> this is an important LaTeX lesson here, fonts are easy with LaTeX
[16:16:34] <spechard> ok
[16:16:38] <spechard> zer0c00l: got a pdf?
[16:16:46] <zer0c00l> spechard: yes got it;
[16:17:10] <spechard> cool, let's proceed
[16:17:33] <spechard> we'll see at the end how to debug errors and warnings
[16:17:39] <spechard> ===========> 13
[16:17:58] <spechard> as I said, you can control very precisely the way your content is organized
[16:18:23] <spechard> the document structure is defined with the following commands
[16:18:29] <-- chandana (n=7c7ca2a8@apocalypse.dreamhost.com) has quit ("CGI:IRC (Ping timeout)")
[16:19:16] <spechard> the command \chapter{Ext4, a modern filesystem} will create a chapter with the title 'Ext4, a modern filesystem'
[16:19:47] <spechard> ===========> 14
[16:20:05] <spechard> here you have the different font size available by default
[16:20:13] <spechard> 10 different ones
[16:20:38] <spechard> as you can see, command names are very easy to remember
[16:20:58] <spechard> in fact, it has to, otherwise it would be very difficult to code
[16:21:19] <spechard> as I say on the slide, there is two ways to define a size
[16:21:38] <spechard> either with an environment: \begin{tiny}...\end{tiny}
[16:21:50] <spechard> or with the shorter \tiny{}
[16:22:26] <spechard> but practically, you'll see you don't need to change font size very often
[16:22:35] <spechard> as LaTeX takes care of that for you :-)
[16:22:41] <spechard> ===========> 15
[16:22:55] <spechard> here are font styles
[16:23:04] <spechard> and the way to generate them
[16:23:09] --> chandana (n=7c7ca2a8@apocalypse.dreamhost.com) has joined #dgplug
[16:23:25] <spechard> can someone tell me the difference between italic and slanted ??
[16:24:45] <spechard> noone ?
[16:25:14] <-- yevlempy (i=75c62586@gateway/web/freenode/x-kbjdlprpcatpuuzp) has quit ("Page closed")
[16:25:26] <zer0c00l> partial italic ?
[16:25:51] <spechard> zer0c00l: not partial, fake :-)
[16:26:09] <zer0c00l> :-)
[16:26:40] <spechard> in fact, italic is a totally new font, created to look like the normal one, but slightly slanted on the right
[16:26:52] <spechard> slanted is the actual normal font, REALLY slanted
[16:27:00] <spechard> which turns to be quite ugly
[16:27:19] <spechard> but sometimes, your font is not available in italic, so this is all you have
[16:27:47] <-- aveek (i=75fee537@gateway/web/freenode/x-hzzymkopfamqcfmm) has quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[16:27:51] <spechard> again, what is the difference between italic and emph ??
[16:28:04] --> kushal (n=kdas@fedora/kushal) has joined #dgplug
[16:28:12] <-- chandana (n=7c7ca2a8@apocalypse.dreamhost.com) has quit ("CGI:IRC (Ping timeout)")
[16:28:31] <spechard> noone ?
[16:29:06] <spechard> ok, this is an important one: italic is about style, while emph is about logic!
[16:29:20] --> chandana (n=7c7ca2a8@67.205.60.108) has joined #dgplug
[16:29:33] <spechard> try to see what \emph{this text is in \emph{italic}} do :-)
[16:29:57] <spechard> then you'll really get what content/form separation means ;-)
[16:30:11] <spechard> still with me?
[16:31:11] <spechard> zer0c00l: kopecks_ kishan chandana: still here?
[16:31:17] <zer0c00l> yes
[16:31:26] <kishan> yes spechard
[16:31:28] <kishan> :)
[16:31:34] <zer0c00l> two time emph on a text makes it normal?
[16:31:36] <spechard> ok :-)
[16:31:44] <spechard> zer0c00l: yes!
[16:31:50] <spechard> zer0c00l: do you see why?
[16:32:12] <zer0c00l> spechard: no,
[16:32:33] <spechard> because it's command that emphasizes text :-)
[16:33:08] <spechard> when you are in the middle of an italic portion, how do you make a word or two more distinguishable?
[16:33:17] <spechard> by making it normal
[16:33:24] <spechard> you see what I mean?
[16:33:29] <zer0c00l> yes
[16:33:35] <spechard> ok good
[16:33:42] <spechard> ===========> 16
[16:33:58] <spechard> a simple one, just to give three positioning environments
[16:34:04] <spechard> ===========> 17
[16:34:10] <spechard> ok, let's do some maths!!
[16:34:13] <spechard> ===========> 18
[16:34:37] <spechard> this is the real power of LaTeX: beautiful and easy-to-type maths formulae
[16:35:01] <spechard> in order to type these commands, you'll need to add the amsmath package
[16:35:06] <-- chandana (n=7c7ca2a8@67.205.60.108) has quit ("CGI:IRC (Ping timeout)")
[16:35:43] <spechard> you may also need some others, usually, when you know you'll type maths, just use: amsmath, amssymb and amsfonts
[16:36:15] <spechard> there is two ways to display an equation: inline or separate
[16:36:29] <spechard> inline mode is used with $...$
[16:36:55] <spechard> on the slide, you see the LaTeX code on the left and what you get in the document on the right
[16:37:29] --> chandana (n=7c7ca2a8@apocalypse.dreamhost.com) has joined #dgplug
[16:37:55] <spechard> when you want an equation separate from the text, use simply \begin{equation}...\end{equation}
[16:38:26] <spechard> both inserted images here are from a showcase that you can find with the sources of this document
[16:38:34] <spechard> ===========> 19
[16:38:55] <spechard> as you can see, there is *a lot* of different symbols
[16:39:05] <spechard> this is just a small preview :-)
[16:39:22] <spechard> and of course, each one is done with its own command...
[16:39:35] <spechard> ===========> 20
[16:39:50] <spechard> here I present basic maths typing
[16:39:58] <spechard> powers are done with ^
[16:40:02] <spechard> indices with _
[16:40:35] <spechard> you can get rid of using {} after ^ and _ if there is only one character
[16:41:08] <spechard> as you may see here, equation rendition is not the same as the previous slide
[16:41:17] <spechard> the slide 18 actually, sorry
[16:41:46] <spechard> this is because they are done directly in the presentation, therefore using the presentation font
[16:41:56] <spechard> ===========> 21
[16:42:22] <spechard> each mathematical notion has its own command: root, sum, integral
[16:42:32] --> parthachowdhury (n=partha@59.93.219.44) has joined #dgplug
[16:42:51] <-- binodc (n=binodc@220.225.125.243) has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
[16:42:56] <spechard> \left( and \right) commands are very useful to let brackets define their own size
[16:43:01] <spechard> ===========> 22
[16:43:15] <spechard> a more complicated one for the end: matrices
[16:43:33] <-- parthachowdhury (n=partha@59.93.219.44) has quit (Client Quit)
[16:43:38] <spechard> this is not the only way to do it actually, but all are usually good :-)
[16:43:57] <spechard> you can see more examples online or in books
[16:44:02] <spechard> ===========> 23
[16:44:16] <spechard> a special one for computer scientists like us: listings
[16:44:34] <spechard> it allows you to display code
[16:44:51] <spechard> with highlighting, line number, etc.
[16:45:10] <spechard> it knows a lot of languages so don't hesitate to use it :-)
[16:45:23] <spechard> I actually use it in this document, as you can guess
[16:45:29] <spechard> ===========> 24
[16:45:46] <spechard> ok, now let's see some things about content
[16:45:51] <spechard> ===========> 25
[16:46:09] <spechard> there is three ways to make lists
[16:46:31] <spechard> these are easy ways to present information
[16:46:41] <spechard> and they are easy to type in LaTeX
[16:47:04] <spechard> here you see the red bullets and number defined by this presentation
[16:47:17] <spechard> on a classical document, it's of course less red :-)
[16:47:38] <spechard> ===========> 26
[16:47:45] <spechard> here's an important slide!
[16:48:06] <spechard> referencing is another very powerful feature of LaTeX
[16:48:14] <spechard> there is three commands
[16:48:44] <-- mbuf (n=mbuf@115.119.41.110) has quit ("Leaving")
[16:48:49] <spechard> with \label{chap:TheFirstPartOfMyLife}, you create a marker called chap:TheFirstPartOfMyLife
[16:49:11] <spechard> now that it is created (it needs a compilation for that)
[16:49:28] <spechard> you can refer to it with \ref{chap:TheFirstPartOfMyLife}
[16:49:59] <spechard> it is replaced by the number assigned to the marker
[16:50:33] <spechard> for example, if you do: \chapter{The First Part of my Life} \label{chap:TheFirstPartOfMyLife}
[16:50:53] <spechard> and say, it is the second chapter of your book
[16:51:01] <spechard> it will simply print 2
[16:51:31] <spechard> and \pageref{chap:TheFirstPartOfMyLife} will print the number of the page where chapter 2 begins
[16:51:51] <spechard> now you may have understood that already: this is a two-step process
[16:52:06] <-- chandana (n=7c7ca2a8@apocalypse.dreamhost.com) has quit ("CGI:IRC (Ping timeout)")
[16:52:16] <spechard> first LaTeX finds the markers and stores them
[16:52:30] <spechard> on the second compilation, it uses them as they defined
[16:53:08] <spechard> this is why a LaTeX output is often obtained with several compilation
[16:53:48] <spechard> don't worry if you made errors in the markers, LaTeX tells you when it misses one :-)
[16:54:03] <spechard> with a nice: LaTeX Warning: There were undeï¬ned references.
[16:54:14] <spechard> easy right? ;-)
[16:54:18] --> chandana (n=7c7ca2a8@apocalypse.dreamhost.com) has joined #dgplug
[16:54:29] <spechard> ===========> 27
[16:54:36] <spechard> now, let's see tables
[16:54:47] <spechard> this is a complex topic in LaTeX
[16:55:25] <spechard> to make a table, we use the tabular environment
[16:56:13] <spechard> with one option, the vertical position: here, bottom, center or top
[16:56:33] <spechard> oh.... I now can see an error in the presentation.... :-(
[16:56:57] <spechard> please read \begin{tabular}[pos]{table spec}...\end{tabular}
[16:57:20] <spechard> the table spec are a mandatory parameter of the tabular environment
[16:57:55] <spechard> this is where you specify the number of columns, their alignment and if you want them surrounded by vertical lines
[16:58:14] <spechard> see the table for all possible parameters
[16:58:34] <spechard> finally, in the table, you use & to separate data from one column to anothe
[16:58:40] <spechard> \\ to start a new row
[16:59:00] <spechard> \hline to display to horizontal line along the whole table
[16:59:33] <spechard> and \cline{3-5} to display a horizontal line from columns 3 to 5 (for example)
[16:59:39] <spechard> ===========> 28
[16:59:50] <spechard> it is surely easier to understand with examples
[16:59:55] <spechard> so here they are
[17:00:17] <spechard> try to carefully understand each line of code here
[17:00:34] <spechard> especially for the second one
[17:00:44] <spechard> told you it was not an easy topic ;-)
[17:01:00] <spechard> are you ok with these examples?
[17:01:39] <zer0c00l> yes :)
[17:01:48] <spechard> cool
[17:01:56] <spechard> ===========> 29
[17:02:08] <spechard> floats are an important notion in LaTeX
[17:02:17] <spechard> a float is an unbreakable box
[17:02:29] <spechard> that can contains anything you want
[17:02:43] <spechard> text, images, rules, formulae, etc.
[17:03:12] <spechard> it is the way LateX deals with putting things on a page
[17:03:43] <spechard> on a complex document, you have a lot of data (text, images, charts, etc.)
[17:04:29] <spechard> putting them in floats allows LaTeX to create an optimal flow of data
[17:05:16] --> lamda_vishal (n=pikh@122.162.68.181) has joined #dgplug
[17:05:30] <spechard> of course, I'm sure you got this: sometimes floats are situated on a different place that where you put them in the code
[17:06:29] <spechard> why? again, because LaTeX knows better than you how to avoid big blanks in documents
[17:06:43] <spechard> and how to harmoniously spread text along the page
[17:06:51] --> SkyKnight (n=Alagunam@122.174.152.85) has joined #dgplug
[17:06:58] --> kishan_ (n=kishan@117.201.98.221) has joined #dgplug
[17:07:03] <spechard> different kind of placement guide are still possible
[17:07:34] <spechard> on a big document, you can put your floats on top of pages with [t]
[17:07:41] <spechard> on the bottom with [b]
[17:07:54] <spechard> or even on a specially created page with [p]
[17:08:24] <spechard> if you say [h], LaTeX will do its best to put it right here, i.e. at the same place that in the code
[17:08:31] <spechard> but nothing is sure
[17:08:40] <spechard> ===========> 30
[17:08:57] <-- chandana (n=7c7ca2a8@apocalypse.dreamhost.com) has quit ("CGI:IRC (Ping timeout)")
[17:09:09] <spechard> here we see how we create floats with tables or figures iin it
[17:09:43] <spechard> this is also the way to put a caption and a label to a table
[17:09:46] <spechard> ===========> 31
[17:09:51] <spechard> remember labels?
[17:10:07] <spechard> floats are numbered, so they can be referred to
[17:10:23] <spechard> gold rule: always put the label after caption!!
[17:10:42] <spechard> this is important, otherwise your references would be erroneous
[17:11:01] <spechard> again here, at least two compilations are needed to get the references right
[17:11:04] --> chandana (n=7c7ca2a8@apocalypse.dreamhost.com) has joined #dgplug
[17:11:07] <spechard> ===========> 32
[17:11:17] <-- kishan_ (n=kishan@117.201.98.221) has quit (Remote closed the connection)
[17:11:20] <spechard> I'm sure you sometimes want to insert graphics in your document :-)
[17:11:22] <spechard> this is how
[17:11:32] <spechard> use \includegraphics[]{} command
[17:11:52] <spechard> as we use pdflatex, we can insert png, jpg and pdf files
[17:12:17] <spechard> there is a lot of options possible here, please the graphicx package documentation
[17:12:30] <spechard> (i'll talk about documentaiton at the end)
[17:13:02] <spechard> and in order to better manage your graphics, make them floats!
[17:13:19] <spechard> with \begin{figure}[]...\end{figure} environment
[17:13:27] <spechard> ===========> 33
[17:14:04] <spechard> I don't know what kind of paper format you use, but here in France, we use A4
[17:14:18] <spechard> and the default size paper in LaTeX is the US letter
[17:14:47] <spechard> to change this, we specify a4format in the documentclass
[17:15:04] <spechard> in fact, everything is changeable
[17:15:07] --> mbuf (n=mbuf@124.123.179.134) has joined #dgplug
[17:15:20] <spechard> on the right scheme, you can see all the measures defined in LaTeX
[17:15:29] <spechard> of course, you have control all of them
[17:15:34] <spechard> +over
[17:15:48] <spechard> the package geometry is very interesting
[17:16:11] <spechard> it allows you to specify things like margins, paper orientation and so on
[17:16:19] <spechard> ===========> 34
[17:16:48] <spechard> if you want to specify headers and footers, you use the fancyhdr package
[17:17:19] <spechard> you define the document page style with the \pagestyle{}
[17:17:45] <spechard> as it is not the default style, you have to specify \pagestyle{fancy}
[17:18:03] <spechard> if you want no headers and footers, you do \pagestyle{empty}
[17:19:06] <spechard> with \fancyhead[]{} and \fancyfoot[]{} you define your headers and footers content
[17:19:28] <spechard> RO and LE options let you say where it is placed on the page
[17:19:33] <spechard> C is for center
[17:20:13] <spechard> you can use some shortcuts like \thepage or \leftmark to get current content in the header
[17:20:20] <spechard> ===========> 35
[17:20:34] <spechard> some small things
[17:20:48] <spechard> LaTeX can understand a lot of measurement units
[17:21:16] <spechard> and as I said for layout, there is a lot of measures you can define, and each one, there is a macro
[17:21:41] <-- kishan (n=kishan@117.201.96.103) has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
[17:21:45] <spechard> finally, three nice commands: \tableofcontents, \listoffigures and \listoftable
[17:22:03] <spechard> their name is very clear  I think, no need to say more
[17:22:09] <spechard> ===========> 36
[17:22:28] <spechard> ok, you can already do a lots with what I covered already
[17:22:35] <spechard> let's go a bit further now
[17:22:40] <spechard> ===========> 37
[17:23:00] <spechard> in order to clarify your code, you can split your document into multiple files
[17:23:25] <spechard> \input{file} and \include{file} do what their name suggests
[17:24:08] <spechard> the use of \include is interesting because with \includeonly{} you can control which one you let for the current compilation
[17:24:28] --> Shrink (n=sgupta@redhat/shrink) has joined #dgplug
[17:24:35] <spechard> the content is still compiled but it is not inserted in the output codument
[17:24:38] <spechard> document
[17:24:54] <spechard> of course, LaTeX allows you to create new commands
[17:25:17] <spechard> with \newcommand{name}[num]{def}
[17:25:37] <spechard> on the slide, you can see an example
[17:25:44] <-- chandana (n=7c7ca2a8@apocalypse.dreamhost.com) has quit ("CGI:IRC (Ping timeout)")
[17:25:47] <spechard> I create a \note command
[17:25:55] <spechard> which takes one argument
[17:26:15] <spechard> in the definition, replace the argument with #1, #2, etc.
[17:26:36] <spechard> on the last line, I create another command \nonotes
[17:27:14] <spechard> it allows you see the \renewcommand command, which do what it says, i.e. modifying the behaviour of an already existing command
[17:27:20] <spechard> ===========> 38
[17:27:33] <spechard> ah: debugging :-)
[17:28:02] --> chandana (n=7c7ca2a8@apocalypse.dreamhost.com) has joined #dgplug
[17:28:03] <spechard> first, don't panic, it's not that uncommun to mistype or myspell something in LaTeX
[17:28:29] <spechard> plus, the system uses well defined errors and warnings to help you correct
[17:28:50] <spechard> even better, an editor may help you in finding them!
[17:28:54] <spechard> ===========> 39
[17:29:18] <spechard> if you compile in the command line, you can say LaTeX what to do when it finds an error
[17:29:57] <spechard> but usually, you use an editor which runs in non-stop mode and analyzes the log to sow you errors
[17:30:03] <spechard> ===========> 40
[17:30:20] <spechard> here is an example of what can be done :-)
[17:30:37] <spechard> actually, it's a new typesetting system, a bit different than LaTeX
[17:30:58] <spechard> it includes modern stuff like unicode and modern fonts like ODF
[17:31:13] <spechard> OTF sorry
[17:31:43] <spechard> its name is xelatex and it's all we're gonna say about it today :-)
[17:31:48] <spechard> ===========> 41
[17:32:13] <spechard> there is *A LOT* of packages available
[17:32:23] <spechard> and of course, you can define yours
[17:32:42] <spechard> I present here a small sample of some useful and famous ones
[17:33:01] <spechard> you can find them on the CTAN website
[17:33:05] <spechard> ===========> 42
[17:33:15] <spechard> finally, a small word about editors
[17:33:29] <spechard> as I said, you can use any text editor
[17:33:49] <spechard> vim and emacs are ok, they even have a specific mode for LaTeX editing
[17:34:09] <spechard> but personally, I prefer kile, which is a LaTeX environment for KDE
[17:34:18] <spechard> very usefull and nice to use
[17:34:22] <spechard> ===========> 43
[17:34:52] <spechard> as a free software, there are a lot of websites talking about LaTeX
[17:35:13] <spechard> but you can also find some good books
[17:35:40] <spechard> I put The TeX book here, but as its name suggests, it's just about TeX
[17:36:07] <spechard> but that's the reference of anyone wanting to know LaTeX and TeX better
[17:36:28] <spechard> ok, the presentation is over now, any question?
[17:36:35] <spechard> but first, ROLL CALL!!
[17:37:19] <-- zer0c00l (n=user@117.207.64.103) has quit (Connection timed out)
[17:39:15] <kushal> kushal
[17:39:48] <spechard> :-)
[17:39:52] <spechard> any question?
[17:40:32] <kushal> chandana, gnukid susmit kopecks_ SkyKnight ?
[17:40:42] <kushal> lamda_vishal, ?
[17:40:43] -*- susmit is here too
[17:41:04] <chandana> Chandana Boral
[17:41:52] <kopecks_> spechard i couldn't attend the session through and through so i will do my homework first then ask questions.
[17:42:09] <spechard> kopecks_: ok
[17:42:21] <kopecks_> spechard,eof
[17:42:34] --> zer0c00l (n=user@117.199.135.18) has joined #dgplug
[17:42:44] <spechard> ok, so if noone has any question by now, let's close the session
[17:42:48] <spechard> zer0c00l: ok?
[17:43:23] <zer0c00l> spechard: i got disconnected
[17:43:26] <zer0c00l> :(
[17:43:43] <spechard> zer0c00l: no problem, nothing happened here :-)
[17:43:48] <spechard> zer0c00l: got questions?
[17:44:06] <zer0c00l> spechard: no
[17:44:10] <spechard> ok, so:
[17:44:16] <spechard> ================ SESSION CLOSED ===================
