[13:49:36] <ace139> Kushal,How you created a bot like this ? Its nice, experienced it for the first time. Can we learn to make such one too ?
[13:49:38] <lixxz> madangel, you can use VMware Player if you like,it is very easy and i can guide you through whole process
[13:49:38] <Prerie_> When i try to install g++, it is shown to be already installed. But, i cannot seem to access it from anywhere-- the terminal or main menu-> all applications.
[13:49:40] <kanika04> okay .

[13:50:50] <kushal> Ok few simple points to remember
[13:50:54] <kushal> for everyone
[13:51:04] <kushal> Never ever directly use root account
[13:51:18] <titli> !
[13:51:21] <kushal> always use a normal user account and then sudo or su  command to become root.
[13:51:26] <kushal> next
[13:51:36] <leero9> !
[13:51:39] <ace139> !
[13:51:49] <yeshi> !
[13:51:53] <singharpit> !
[13:52:05] <titli> kushal, why so?
[13:52:18] <kushal> titli, just type that full question in google.com
[13:52:22] <kushal> titli, you will know
[13:52:28] <kushal> next
[13:52:34] <shockzp> !
[13:52:40] <titli> does any change by the root will affect the other users?
[13:52:43] <Prerie_> !
[13:53:00] <amit001> titli, it will affect whole system
[13:53:04] <leero9> I used root a lot of times haven't faced any trouble, why would you say so ?
[13:53:08] <kushal> titli, yes
[13:53:10] <deepu_tp> titli, depends on what you change
[13:53:15] <titli> amit001,ok.
[13:53:18] <leero9> kushal ? EOF
[13:53:20] <kushal> leero9, ask that question to google
[13:53:27] <kushal> leero9, thanks for writing EOF
[13:53:34] <kushal> others are not doing it.
[13:53:37] <kushal> next
[13:53:39] <ace139> kushal, You said not to use root account directly, but to install anything the system asks for root permission. Why so ? <eof>
[13:53:52] <madangel> !
[13:53:59] <kushal> ace139, I said, use a normal account and then become root when required
[13:54:07] <kushal> and then you can install anything you want.
[13:54:09] <kushal> next
[13:54:26] <yeshi> kushal,can you please explain what did you mean by root account here<eof>
[13:54:51] <deepu_tp> yeshi, the user called root
[13:55:07] <kushal> yeshi, type this question in google.com:   what is root account in linux?
[13:55:10] <kushal> next
[13:55:13] <singharpit> how to make a normal account?eof
[13:55:33] <titli> yeshi, it is like the administrator account<eof>
[13:55:36] <kushal> singharpit, when you install linux it generally ask you to create an account.
[13:55:40] <deepu_tp> singharpit, sudo adduser <name of user>
[13:55:45] <chandan_kumar> next
[13:55:47] <shockzp> I use Mac OSX, is it okay if i learn on Mac OS itself? or is there any advantage learning on Ubuntu?<eof>

[14:01:42] <kushal> Even though there are GUI applications, you will find that most developers prefer to use command line tools
[14:01:54] <kushal> These tools/apps runs on the terminal
