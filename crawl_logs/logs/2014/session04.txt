Jul 02 19:21:36 <PraveenKarol>	Regarding, opening of files in Ubuntu 14.04GNome. This rigtht click option and open with other applications does not list all the applications. We've to manually search for the applications. Is it possible to get the applications listed as in Windows?

Jul 02 19:21:46 <Poornima>	tonythomas, yes
Jul 02 19:21:48 <CuriousLearner>	kanika04: pushd actually makes a stack and push it to your current path, popd helps in removing that. It just help you in moving back and forth with ease.

Jul 02 19:22:07 <kushal>	PraveenKarol, Do not know that, ask in the Ubuntu channels for more help.
Jul 02 19:22:19 <lixxz>	 ^^
Jul 02 19:22:21 <vipsy>	kanika04, when you decide to to move to another directory from your current working directory, you use pushd. When you want to come back to the previous directory you were working in, popd

Jul 02 19:48:18 <mnw94>	I learnt a lot more in the first 4 days than I expected to .
Jul 02 19:48:26 <sivteck>	leave notices and mails without subject flooding my inbox
Jul 02 19:48:34 <titli>	Random discussions make it confusing sometimes.

Jul 02 19:49:03 <unknown21>	sivteck, +2
Jul 02 19:49:04 <Poornima>	on practice
Jul 02 19:49:06 <thejaman>	Topics are random and hard to get the gist midway.
Jul 02 19:49:07 <titli>	But the random topics help us know new things. :) <eof>
Jul 02 19:49:13 <Jupiter>	session was good......we could learn more linux commands through different questions...
Jul 02 19:49:16 <acetakwas>	I second sivteck; I don't see the need in notifying about missing classes. We understand we all have different schedules.
Jul 02 19:49:19 <mnw94>	sivteck ,agreed that mails are sometimes an issue
Jul 02 19:49:26 <dev212>	Lot of topics overlapping eachother and even the questions too , running over one another
Jul 02 19:49:43 <Poornima>	kushal, i mean practicals are important

Jul 02 19:51:20 <leero9>	Three month course, I am sure kushal has a lot of practicals in store, it just began.

Jul 02 19:52:28 <kushal>	ramsan, let us please go through the above list.
Jul 02 19:52:28 <mnw94>	ramsan, wondering the same
Jul 02 19:52:39 <kushal>	nmzaheer, No coding yes, 
Jul 02 19:52:45 <kushal>	Many people are new here.
Jul 02 19:52:56 <kushal>	So we want them to go through some basics first.
Jul 02 19:53:12 <kushal>	So that everyone are at least in similar conditionl.
Jul 02 19:53:17 <kushal>	condition.
Jul 02 19:53:34 <kushal>	Not moving fast is also for the same reason.
Jul 02 19:53:59 <kushal>	There are new people, give them time, after few days you may want to tell us to go slow :)
Jul 02 19:54:23 <nmzaheer>	i thought we'll atleast do some shell scripting to familiarise with commands and do fun stuff.but i agree with your point.
Jul 02 19:54:34 *	rahulmishra has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
Jul 02 19:54:38 <kushal>	nmzaheer, Yes, I will come to that point tonight :)
Jul 02 19:55:01 <kushal>	ruprela, Not telling what topics will be covered, because we want you to attend all the sessions :)
Jul 02 19:55:01 *	humpty has quit (Quit: Page closed)
Jul 02 19:55:17 <ruprela>	+1 :)
Jul 02 19:55:19 <kushal>	People asking random questions is always a problem.
Jul 02 19:55:31 <kushal>	But with time people learn not to do that.
Jul 02 19:55:38 <CuriousLearner>	kushal: but you can tell all the topics, not in order, but so that we know what to expect :)
Jul 02 19:56:13 <humpty_>	i just read about dgplug on quora and i am here. But i got to know i am already late by few days. can i continue and is it possible to catch up?
Jul 02 19:56:16 <kushal>	Remember that this is for new people and they will learn how to behave before they go into other big projects :)

Jul 02 19:56:55 <kushal>	CuriousLearner, slowly :)
Jul 02 19:57:14 <kushal>	Home work read only -- Yes, because there was no real home work yet :)
Jul 02 19:57:18 <acetakwas>	kushal, I agree with get people to familiarise with basics. Many of us indeed are first timers. I believe there are people who do not even talk during these sessions, instead they just read.
Jul 02 19:57:20 <kushal>	It will come in.
Jul 02 19:57:26 <acetakwas>	getting*
Jul 02 19:57:31 <unknown21>	kushal, waiting for it :)
Jul 02 19:57:34 <CuriousLearner>	kushal: +1, By the way, I like these sessions. :)

Jul 02 19:57:57 <kushal>	acetakwas, correct and they are missing the point, you are supposed to make mistakes here. Then you learn from those mistakes and do not repeat them.
Jul 02 19:58:03 <Poornima>	well kushal i have a suggestion on this situation what if you give small practicals as well in home work around the topic eg (communication class: configure the irc on test box/ or shell class some commands exercise like create file,modify and delete) so that new beginners will capture accordingly
Jul 02 19:58:23 <acetakwas>	kushal, ;)
Jul 02 19:58:44 <kushal>	Poornima, so we have some sort of ideas how we will manage, I hope you will find them useful.
Jul 02 19:58:55 <kushal>	Poornima, but we will keep your point in mind.

Jul 02 19:59:30 <kushal>	I thought that would be good idea but few minutes back even mbuf talked with me about them.
Jul 02 19:59:49 <kushal>	It seems everyone is happily sending those emails. 
Jul 02 19:59:52 *	rdas has quit (Quit: Leaving)
Jul 02 20:00:15 <kushal>	So I think we can stop them, no more leave notices are required in the list from now on.
Jul 02 20:00:19 <acetakwas>	kushal, actually mails are getting unnecessarily flooded.
Jul 02 20:00:21 <kushal>	mbuf, Thanks for pinging me.
Jul 02 20:00:37 <CuriousLearner>	kushal: The problem is, every new guy post in a new email, it feels like spam, rather if there's only one mail, and people post the reply, it would be good, or else it can be ignored all together.
Jul 02 20:00:50 <acetakwas>	Yes! \o/
Jul 02 20:00:54 <kushal>	CuriousLearner, yes, that we can not control.
Jul 02 20:00:55 <ruprela>	kushal, what is the homework for today ?
Jul 02 20:01:01 <kushal>	ruprela, wait please :)
Jul 02 20:01:08 <EkAurBottleLa>	instead of leave mails, why don't you create a google form for those to fill?
Jul 02 20:01:25 <Poornima>	awesome :-)
Jul 02 20:01:26 <kushal>	Any other feedback please? good/bad?

Jul 02 20:02:14 <mbuf>	Poornima, whatever is discussed in class can be tried on your home PC; homework and practicals are usually something that you build based on the discussions that you have here
Jul 02 20:02:27 <acetakwas>	kushal, you are yet to attend to my last question. Do I post it again?
Jul 02 20:02:30 <DhritiShikhar_>	learnt a lot. :)
Jul 02 20:02:34 *	giri_gb is now known as girib
Jul 02 20:02:36 <kushal>	acetakwas, ask
Jul 02 20:02:41 <acetakwas>	Questions asked should not be displayed until the batul permits; that way things may appear more orderly
Jul 02 20:02:45 <mbuf>	Poornima, and you document or write a tutorial on the same for your reference; the idea is not to correct your home work, but, to teach you how to learn
Jul 02 20:02:52 <ruprela>	slow speed is good for beginners
Jul 02 20:03:06 <leero9>	how can batul know if thats a question ?
Jul 02 20:03:35 <yogeshwar>	leero9,might be regex may help
Jul 02 20:03:38 <kushal>	yeah, acetakwas batul is not smart :)
Jul 02 20:03:47 <CuriousLearner>	leero9: Just in case anyone wants to ask he would post !
Jul 02 20:03:50 <kushal>	yogeshwar, patches are welcome :)
Jul 02 20:03:51 <mbuf>	Poornima, you should list down what you need to learn, jot them down, create a plan, discuss with mentors here, estimate, and work on it
Jul 02 20:04:02 <kushal>	everyone ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Jul 02 20:04:03 <titli>	kushal, I think before you say next, let discussion over the previous topic finish.
Jul 02 20:04:10 <kushal>	titli, ok.
Jul 02 20:04:13 <acetakwas>	Like in a classroom nobody talks except when permitted; you simply raise your hand
Jul 02 20:04:16 *	devmodem has quit (Client Quit)
Jul 02 20:04:26 <mbuf>	Poornima, mentors are here to guide you, and spoon-feeding is generally discussed; the problem with giving specific homework is that students think that is all there is to it

Jul 02 20:04:43 <CuriousLearner>	May be if batul detects a question mark, he would know it's a question.
Jul 02 20:04:47 <yogeshwar>	kushal,i am still a newbie but will try to learn to make batul smart
Jul 02 20:04:49 <mbuf>	Poornima, honestly, there is always something to be learnt every day
Jul 02 20:04:51 <Amalesh>	Hi Kushal, you had mentioned that after the summer training we would be able to contribute to some upstream projects, it would be good if you discuss briefly  about  atleast one upstream project per session; just briefly not indetail
Jul 02 20:04:51 <nmzaheer>	acetakwas, that'll become many-to-one relationship.We need to behave as a community so we need to encourage people to ask questions which anyone can reply not only kushal
Jul 02 20:05:04 <titli>	mbuf,+1 and people should keep discussing after sessions too.
Jul 02 20:05:05 <humpty_>	i have a question, however i can use irc on my cs50 appliance which is modified version of fedora, whats the problem with windows?

Jul 02 20:05:45 <mbuf>	titli, people can stay on the channel whenever they are online, not, only when a session starts; this is not a classroom
Jul 02 20:06:05 <kushal>	acetakwas, we do not want to do that as that will stop people to give some vital input time to time.
Jul 02 20:06:07 <mbuf>	it takes time for people to get the hang of it, but, we are patient, as always :)

Jul 02 20:06:49 <acetakwas>	kushal, okay another question
Jul 02 20:06:53 <mbuf>	Poornima, in the community, there is no one mentor; you can work with many people
Jul 02 20:07:02 <acetakwas>	We should exclude server msgs in the class logs; they get unnecessarily long due to this

Jul 02 20:09:16 <mbuf>	Poornima, there is a mind set that is required in order to work in F/OSS; and that is what we want you to learn
Jul 02 20:09:21 <humpty_>	why do i need irc client, i am working fine without it.
Jul 02 20:09:53 <Poornima>	mbuf, i will learn soon
Jul 02 20:10:00 <kushal>	humpty_, without IRC you would not be able to ask this question to me and get the answer right away.
Jul 02 20:10:19 <kushal>	humpty_, read the pdf and log mentioned in the first session

Jul 02 20:11:47 <kushal>	You have to be there to use them.

Jul 02 20:15:28 <acetakwas>	Are we expected to complete that 916-page book before the next session?
Jul 02 20:15:32 <CuriousLearner>	Would take time, but I would get through it and learn it. :)
Jul 02 20:15:37 <EkAurBottleLa>	kushal, hahaha.. we can read at our pace right? take as much time to finish that book?
Jul 02 20:15:43 <kushal>	acetakwas, of course not.
Jul 02 20:15:44 <kushal>	EkAurBottleLa, yes
Jul 02 20:16:09 <kushal>	acetakwas, that is only for the people who thinks we are going sloooow.

Jul 02 20:24:16 <leero9>	look inside files ?
Jul 02 20:24:23 *	ruprela has quit (Quit: Leaving)
Jul 02 20:24:32 <leero9>	It is basically used to match patterns and print them
Jul 02 20:24:40 <yogeshwar>	kushal, batul ,superhero of dgplug training.
Jul 02 20:24:43 <iamviknesh>	yeshi: you can search for a particular string in a file -----> grep "some_string" file_name
Jul 02 20:24:59 <tonythomas>	yeshi: grep can be used to find occurences of a string inside a file, or many files inside a directory. try using grep -R 'string' * ( this will print occurences inside current dir )
Jul 02 20:25:10 <leero9>	use 'man grep' in your terminal or google it
Jul 02 20:25:14 <titli>	yeshi, you may create a file first to understand.

Jul 02 20:28:16 <humpty_>	just one more silly question. How long is this training program? means for many weeks will it run?
Jul 02 20:28:21 <CuriousLearner>	kushal: In many cases we use -R with Linux commands, I know it's kind of parameter but I want to know what does it do?
Jul 02 20:28:37 <CuriousLearner>	humpty_:  3 months.

Jul 02 20:29:53 <orriols>	CuriousLearner: though is completely dependent on the command. Some use -r, some use -R for the same, recursion
Jul 02 20:29:55 <titli>	CuriousLearner, man the command with -R option.

Jul 02 20:30:53 <titli>	CuriousLearner, for example, with ls -R means recursive but with rmdir -r means recursive.
