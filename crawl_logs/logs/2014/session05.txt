Jul 03 19:19:32 <kushal>	leero9, because when you will have to connect to a server half way around the world, gedit can not help you to edit files there.
Jul 03 19:19:48 <acetakwas_>	shankho, it must be your first time using the tty
Jul 03 19:20:07 <kushal>	leero9, also with a proper editor training, you can do things super fast, be it in vim or emacs

Jul 03 19:22:34 <acetakwas_>	Shankho, okay
Jul 03 19:22:38 <zetron>	nmzaheer: depends on file extension you enter during file creation
Jul 03 19:22:59 <deepak_sirone>	nmzaheer, what are CR and LF ?
Jul 03 19:23:11 <deepu_tp>	nmzaheer: Latin-1 (source : http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/23389/how-can-i-set-vims-default-encoding-to-utf-8)
