[14:08:27] <kushal> and if you do anything stupid you might be kicked out, so be right back in after that
[14:09:00] <iam_sudip> NBharech, Andchat is another option.
[14:09:08] <Armageddon> vipsy: you should read these, you might learn something new
[14:09:26] <kushal> I hope everyone is registered to IRC because after few days only registered and identified people will be able to talk.
