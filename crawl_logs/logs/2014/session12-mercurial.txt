[13:35:25] <sayan> next
[13:35:30] <humpty> chandankumar, i read that and i am even able to add image present in my folder. but the problem is i want to add an image of  mine from the web and i am unable to do that
[13:35:35] <acetakwas> donniezazen, http://piratepad.net/HKVLwvc64q
[13:35:46] <Mactoc> sorry, I couldn't  submit it , Can I submit it after  today's session?
[13:35:47] <humpty> chandankumar, what to to do for this?
[13:36:03] <sayan> Mactoc, yes
[13:36:26] <sayan> humpty, download the image and save it in the image directory
[13:36:45] <Mactoc> sayan, Thank you
[13:36:50] <amit001> sayan link also works
[13:37:01] <sayan> humpty, ^^
[13:37:03] <acetakwas> sayan, ;o
[13:37:13] <humpty> sayan, but then when i would publish my page on web or github, will that image still show up?
[13:37:43] <humpty> because that image is in my computer and not on the web.
[13:37:54] <sayan> humpty, try that out, i usually save the images in my image directory
[13:38:15] <humpty> sayan, in that case it is working.
[13:38:43] <acetakwas> humpty, make it a practice to have your images in one folder
[13:38:49] <acetakwas> like this:
[13:38:56] <sayan> humpty, i don't know if pasting link works or not. i have never tried that out.
[13:39:01] <humpty> sayan, but how would you and others be able to see it then.
[13:39:27] <acetakwas> Do 'mkdir img' in your root folder
[13:39:29] <humpty> sayan, i tried but it's not working. it just shows that link in the html file and not he image
[13:39:33] <amit001> humpty, pasting links also works
[13:39:36] <humpty> s/he/the
[13:39:43] <acetakwas> then move your images to the folder 'img'
[13:40:01] <humpty> amit001, then tell me how?
[13:40:18] <amit001> humpty, see this http://amitt001.github.io/  click on human icon
[13:40:32] <amit001> humpty, http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html
[13:40:48] <amit001> here insted of image.jpg use the link
[13:41:18] <acetakwas> afterwards you can link to any image (e.g 'image001' in folder 'img') by indicating the source directory as 'res/image001'
[13:41:21] <humpty> amit001, are you sure of that because i have already done that but it didn't work.
[13:41:57] <amit001> yes I am. doubt? ok on my image cklick inspect element and see the link
[13:42:14] <amit001> s/cklick/click
[13:42:38] <sayan> amit001, can you the share the rst file for that page to humpty instead?
[13:42:58] <sayan> amit001, it must be on github, so share the link
[13:43:29] <humpty> amit001, yes because inspect element is showing me the html version and not the rst one
[13:44:23] <amit001> sayan, actually i uploaded the html version
[13:44:43] <amit001> humpty i wwill pass you the link after uploading my rst to gdrive
[13:44:53] <amit001> s/wwill/will
[13:44:55] <eeshangarg> !
[13:45:18] <humpty> amit001, in that case let me show you what i did.
[13:46:41] <humpty> amit001, .. image:: https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos?pid=5976132931173895458&oid=102513899573780558485&authkey=CO2Jre-4w_qklwE
[13:46:58] <humpty> amit001, i think this is all what i need to do
[13:47:09] <humpty> to get my image there
[13:47:19] <amit001> here is the my rst file http://ur1.ca/hr089
[13:47:26] <amit001> humpty talk in pm
[13:48:02] <humpty> amit001, thanks and ok
[13:48:10] <kushal> next
[13:48:16] <eeshangarg> i was late. was there any homework for today? also can you please tell me what today's session is about?
[13:48:27] <kushal> eeshangarg, discussion on last week
[13:51:08] <kushal> So any other question?
[13:51:32] <kushal> none, good.
[13:51:35] <kushal> Few points
[13:51:42] m4_15_ is now known as m4_15
[13:52:13] <kushal> Please remember to submit your hometasks, we will be selecting people from there to be added for various future sessions.
[13:52:28] <kushal> From now on, sessions will be 3 days a week
[13:52:36] <kushal> Monday, Wednesday, Friday
[13:52:55] <kushal> It can be on other days but those will be guest sessions mostly.
[13:52:59] <donniezazen> !
[13:53:02] <kushal> next
[13:53:13] <donniezazen> What is the basis of selection?
[13:53:40] <kushal> donniezazen, people who will keep submitting the hometasks
[13:53:46] <kushal> donniezazen, nothing fancy
[13:53:56] <ace139> !
[13:54:02] <kushal> donniezazen, just have to show they are willing to put time and effort
[13:54:04] <kushal> next
[13:54:07] <ace139> kushal, what will be in the guest sessions ?
[13:54:15] <ace139> <eof>
[13:54:20] <kushal> ace139, not decided yet.
[13:54:31] <acetakwas> kushal, good
[13:54:41] <EkAurBottleLa> !
[13:54:43] <ace139> kushal, we are not allowed to join ? <eof>
[13:54:56] <kushal> ace139, everyone is allowed to join
[13:55:29] <sayan> next
[13:55:32] <EkAurBottleLa> will it be 3 days a week just for the next few weeks or till the end of the course? <eof>
[13:55:35] <kushal> ace139, but say, we need to provide username/password, we will choose people who are coming online regularly and who submit hometasks back
[13:55:45] <acetakwas> ace139, I think he means that the guest sessions will be on talks from invited folks, not necessarily tutorials
[13:55:56] <kushal> EkAurBottleLa, till the end
[13:56:03] <kushal> acetakwas, yes
[13:56:05] <sayan> next
[13:57:08] <kushal> Ok
[13:57:24] <kushal> So next we will learn the basics of a version control system.
[13:57:24] <_krash> !
[13:57:28] <kushal> next
[13:57:50] <_krash> when you wil declare who all are eligible for the session
[13:58:17] <kushal> _krash, everyone is eligible by default
[13:58:31] <_krash> I mean special sessions
[13:58:33] <kushal> _krash, but we must know the names/blogs and see some effort from them too.
[13:58:44] <kushal> _krash, yes, I am talking about those sessions too
[13:58:54] <_krash> thanks
[13:58:57] <_krash> <eof>
[13:58:58] <acetakwas> !
[13:59:08] <kushal> next
[13:59:25] <acetakwas> Can anyone give me pointers on how to setup and use Pelican in PM?
[13:59:43] <kushal> acetakwas, use Nikola, far better anyday.
[13:59:54] <amit001> nikola +1
[13:59:57] <kushal> acetakwas, also please do not ask out of session questions.
[14:00:11] <acetakwas> kushal, okay
[14:00:16] <kushal> coming back to the session
[14:01:09] <kushal> The first source code management we will learn is called mercurial.

[14:05:16] <acetakwas> It's just about 2.5MB
[14:05:26] <m4_15> my system will take some time due to slow network .
[14:05:36] <kushal> silentSae, you are supposed to use a computer
[14:06:02] <acetakwas> silentSae, during sessions
[14:06:04] <CuriousLearner> acetakwas, It's downloading dependencies too.
[14:06:51] <Prash_5421> How to check if it is installed? I'm a bit confused.
[14:07:31] <CuriousLearner> Prash_542, It would show you finished, if using fedora, and something similar in other linux distros.
[14:07:37] <Mactoc> Prash_5421: Type hg in your command line
[14:07:40] <acetakwas> CuriousLearner, okay but I think all of that is included in the 2.5MB archive
[14:07:59] <Prash_5421> Mactoc thanks.
[14:08:09] <Mactoc> Prash_5421:  :)
[14:08:29] <CuriousLearner> acetakwas, no, it downloaded around 11MB+ dependencies and now, it's downloading the main package.

[14:10:09] <humpty> kushal, what does it mean by source code management
[14:10:24] <m4_15> done
[14:10:36] <acetakwas> CuriousLearner, Yeah I now understand you
[14:10:37] <humpty> CuriousLearner, same here!
[14:10:39] <korak1> done
[14:11:00] <acetakwas> I probably have some of those dependencies installed already, while you don't
[14:11:14] <abhiram_rk> acetakwas: +1
[14:11:18] <kushal> humpty, good question, I am coming to that point
[14:11:30] <acetakwas> abhiram_rk, ;)
[14:11:30] <kushal> First
[14:11:40] <kushal> Everyone else please stop talking
[14:11:44] <humpty> CuriousLearner, actually it's actually 12M
[14:11:44] <kushal> next
[14:12:16] <kushal> How many of you did any school/college project and kept source code from different day in different folder in a usb drive?
[14:12:21] * kushal did.
[14:12:51] <abhiram_rk> Me. Kept creating zip folders of each day's revisions.
[14:12:59] * ace139 did
[14:13:05] <iamviknesh> yeah i did
[14:13:07] <_krash> did
[14:13:13] <humpty> kushal, could not understand.
[14:13:17] <EkAurBottleLa> q
[14:13:20] * CuriousLearner didn't
[14:13:23] <dhritishikhar_> Yes. I did.
[14:13:30] <acetakwas> I kind of overwrote/merged them
[14:13:41] <m4_15> i did.
[14:13:58] <silentSae>  Me too
[14:13:59] * humpty didn't
[14:14:11] <kushal> humpty, which one? the question?
[14:14:25] <acetakwas> humpty, if you've worked on something that you made updates to almost everyday
[14:14:26] <humpty> kushal, yes but understood it now!
[14:14:31] <korak1> !
[14:14:49] <acetakwas> then had the work of each day saved in separate folders
[14:14:58] <humpty> acetakwas, no, never!
[14:15:20] <vipsy> kushal, excuse me. I will have to leave for now. Will read the log.
[14:15:35] <kushal> next
[14:15:56] <korak1> what will the advantages of mercurial over git?
[14:16:23] <kushal> korak1, simple, google.com
[14:16:41] * acetakwas bids vipsy farewell
[14:16:41] <kushal> so coming back to my point
[14:16:45] <korak1> ok
[14:17:03] <iamviknesh> korak1: i think mercurial is good for newbie :)
[14:17:19] <kushal> iamviknesh, please STOP TALKING.
[14:17:27] <kushal>  We all had some issues in managing source code/text files, which we updated regularly.
[14:18:00] <kushal> From the name source code management for SCM, we can understand it talks about managing the source code somehow.
[14:18:12] <kushal> There are many available software which does that.
[14:18:24] <kushal> We will only learn two of those,
[14:19:45] <kushal> RCS was the oldest I know about, from there CVS came in.
[14:19:54] <kushal> then it was the days of SVN
[14:20:09] <kushal> and then these days people are using git and mercurial.
[14:20:19] <kushal> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_revision_control_software is nice page to read later.
[14:20:56] <acetakwas> full meanings please 'RCS', 'SVN'?
[14:21:15] <kushal> acetakwas, read that wikipedia page when you have time :)
[14:21:49] <kushal> To start we will learn Mercurial
[14:23:03] <kushal> first everyone create a new folder called myproject
[14:23:09] <kushal> then go inside it
[14:23:13] <silentSae>  /
[14:23:44] <kushal> silentSae, ?
[14:24:10] <silentSae> Sorry phone issues
[14:25:01] <kushal> now let us create a file called hello.txt
[14:25:07] <kushal> inside it write
[14:25:11] <kushal> Hello World.
[14:25:37] <kushal> Tell me when you are done.

[14:42:01] <kushal> CuriousLearner, nope, I asked it to save as ~/.hgrc
[14:42:12] <abhiram_rk> Should I save it as ~/.hgrc or just .hgrc?
[14:42:17] <CuriousLearner> kushal, it's not accepting that name
[14:42:23] <abhiram_rk> The former goes into my home directory. <eof>
[14:42:30] <humpty> CuriousLearner, do the changes in your name and mail id and save it again.

[14:43:02] <CuriousLearner> root directory
[14:43:05] <acetakwas> abhiram_rk, ~/ is your home directory not part of the file name
[14:43:09] <EkAurBottleLa> ok.
[14:43:17] <sivteck> everone ! filename: .hgrc , folder: home
[14:43:20] <kushal> CuriousLearner, nope
[14:43:25] <kushal> CuriousLearner, home directory.
[14:43:26] <sivteck> everyone*
[14:43:26] <abhiram_rk> So I should save it in the current directory right?
[14:43:33] <abhiram_rk> myproject?
[14:43:34] <kushal> abhiram_rk, nope
[14:43:36] <acetakwas> save it with the name '.hgrc' not '~/.hgrc'
[14:44:02] <acetakwas> When you do wget it gets downloaded to your current folder
[14:44:19] <acetakwas> that is, current working directory, do you understand?
[14:44:29] <kushal> next
[14:44:30] <humpty> acetakwas, no we have to save it with ~./hgrc
[14:44:31] <lixxz> type cd it will take you to your home directory
[14:44:40] <kushal> humpty, wrong
[14:44:45] <acetakwas> then move it to your home directory

[14:44:47] <kushal> humpty, ~/.hgrc
[14:44:58] <kushal> abhiram_rk, listen what I am saying
[14:45:12] <humpty> kushal, sorry typing mistake1
[14:45:12] * abhiram_rk gives kushal thumbs-up!
[14:45:14] <kushal> In your home directory save the file as .hgrc
[14:45:21] <amit001> for those who dont know what does ~/ mean - it is your home directory
[14:45:22] <kushal> Next
[14:45:25] <acetakwas> like this in terminal: mv hgrc ~/
[14:45:25] <abhiram_rk> Done.
[14:45:40] <kushal> amit001,  for those who dont know what does ~/ mean, they should leave the training now.
[14:45:52] <acetakwas> then you can go to home directory which is ~/
[14:45:53] <amit001> kushal, :)
[14:45:56] <kushal> now try hg commit
[14:46:05] <kushal> It will open up an editor

[15:17:35] <kushal> iamviknesh, no
[15:17:40] <kushal> iamviknesh, he did hg add
[15:17:55] <iamviknesh> oh sorry my mistake :P
[15:18:05] <kushal> After you see the status, we will do another commit
[15:18:17] <ahhda> now it says A bye.txt
[15:18:19] <kushal> But before that I want everyone to be in same status
[15:18:35] <kushal> ahhda, yes, correct, it should have another change in hello.txt file.
[15:19:45] <ahhda> Both differ in colour
[15:20:18] <kushal> ahhda, and a character in front
[15:20:24] <acetakwas> kushal, what change please?
[15:20:26] <donniezazen> A bye.txt
[15:20:33] <ahhda> Yes, M hello.txt
[15:20:36] <kushal> acetakwas, ?
[15:21:04] <humpty> kushal, sorry for that and finally i am no more lagging behind!
[15:21:11] <acetakwas> you said, it should have another change in the hello.txt file and a character in front
[15:21:17] <acetakwas> I don't understand that
[15:21:35] <acetakwas> What I have in my terminal is:
[15:21:39] <ahhda> acetakwas by change he meant difference
[15:21:40] <humpty> acetakwas, yeah done with it, was doing that silly mistake
[15:21:41] <acetakwas> M hello.txt
[15:21:47] <acetakwas> A bye.txt
[15:22:00] <lixxz> acetakwas, you are good to go
[15:22:02] <kushal> acetakwas,  yes, that is the thing I was talking as ahhda wrote about only bye.txt
[15:22:12] <acetakwas> humpty, okay cool ;)
[15:22:24] <acetakwas> okay
[15:23:33] <kushal> Now before we do the third commit, we should learn a little bit about commit messages.
[15:23:54] <kushal> They should be meaningful, in present tense generally
[15:24:13] * abhiram_rk is finally on board.
[15:24:17] <kushal> After the first line you can actually start adding up more details.
[15:24:26] <kushal> Let me show an example.
[15:26:03] <kushal> Read the commit message I used just now
[15:26:04] <kushal> http://paste.fedoraproject.org/117846/14053513/raw/
[15:26:23] <kushal> Remember to give a blank line between first line and next paragraph.
[15:27:44] <kushal> now everyone commit it.
[15:27:51] <kushal> with a proper message like mine.
[15:27:58] <humpty> !
[15:28:00] <kushal> and then do hg log
[15:28:04] <kushal> next
[15:28:10] <acetakwas> should we type that
[15:28:14] <humpty> kushal, but why is that blank line required?
[15:28:18] <acetakwas> ?
[15:28:32] <kushal> humpty, do a hg log
[15:28:46] <kushal> acetakwas, type the message I typed.
[15:28:47] <lixxz_> repeat last line please got disconnected
[15:29:04] <iamviknesh> the text after new line don't show up in hg log
[15:29:06] <kushal> lixxz_, use waartaa please
[15:29:07] <CuriousLearner> kushal, it shows just first line, working fine? or I'm on completely different track?
[15:29:11] <kushal> iamviknesh, CuriousLearner yes
[15:29:18] <acetakwas> in the hello.txt file?
[15:29:29] <kushal> acetakwas, no as the commit message.
[15:29:35] <lixxz_> kushal, it doesn't happen that often
[15:29:42] lixxz_ is now known as lixxz
[15:30:04] <kushal> CuriousLearner, iamviknesh people do not want to read the whole commit message, they will get an idea about the commit from the first line
[15:30:12] <kushal> and then if required they will read about it.
[15:30:37] <iamviknesh> kushal: oh ok :)
[15:30:52] <thejaman> !
[15:31:16] <kushal> next
[15:31:19] <RakRock> !
[15:31:22] <kushal> next
[15:31:29] <thejaman> So how do we get to read that extra commit message?
[15:31:33] <iamviknesh> !
[15:31:39] <kushal> thejaman, I am coming to that
[15:31:40] <kushal> next
[15:31:50] <RakRock> Same question as Thejaman
[15:31:53] <iamviknesh> kushal: yeah the same question :)
[15:32:54] <kushal> Now can everyone see a changeset number for the 3rd commit?
[15:33:02] <kushal> use that number like below
[15:33:05] <ace139> yes
[15:33:22] <kushal> hg log -v -r 0e558dd2a91d
[15:33:35] <kushal> -v is for verbose
[15:34:14] <RakRock> got it, Thanks
[15:34:27] <iamviknesh> yeah , full commit message :)
[15:34:47] <CuriousLearner> done
[15:34:58] <sivteck> done
[15:34:59] <kushal> Now say you do not want to commit while you are writing the commit message
[15:35:09] <kushal> Just do not save that file and exit
[15:35:12] <kushal> :q!
[15:35:16] <kushal> ^^ in vim
[15:35:19] <acetakwas> done
[15:35:22] <kushal> It will not commit it
[15:35:30] <CuriousLearner> !
[15:35:31] <kushal> first make any change to hello.txt
[15:35:42] <acetakwas> okay
[15:35:50] <kushal> and then try to commit and then from the commit message editor do that above command.
[15:35:54] <kushal> and exit
[15:35:54] <kushal> next
[15:36:08] <CuriousLearner> So this means in order to commit a change it is necessary to write something as commit message, even if it's just a word? Right? kushal
[15:36:32] <kushal> CuriousLearner, yes
[15:36:44] <kushal> CuriousLearner, better if you can write a proper commit message.
[15:37:04] <acetakwas> done
[15:37:11] <CuriousLearner> got it, thanks

[15:41:16] <RakRock> Can I revert just one version of changes ? i.e go to currentversion -1 ?
[15:41:27] <korak1> !
