Jul 05 19:45:57 *	deepu has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
Jul 05 19:46:07 <kushal>	arpita, we use them to browse the code
Jul 05 19:46:20 <kushal>	so that it becomes very easy to move arround 
Jul 05 19:46:23 <kushal>	* around
Jul 05 19:46:52 <arpita>	how do we browse the code?
Jul 05 19:47:08 <kushal>	arpita, that is what I told last night 
Jul 05 19:47:13 <kushal>	arpita, go check your logs
Jul 05 19:47:37 <kushal>	ria, problem fixed, from now on please delete any swp file vi creates 
Jul 05 19:47:49 <kushal>	ria, and also recreate  the tags file please 
Jul 05 19:47:56 <arpita>	that entire process that we did in pyrfid.c was only the browsing of code??

Jul 05 19:49:33 <rtnpro>	kushal, does that mean that if we don't create the tag file
Jul 05 19:49:45 <ria>	:! ctags *.ch is this the command to create kushal ?
Jul 05 19:49:46 <rtnpro>	kushal, then we can't use ctrl+

Jul 05 20:06:08 <rtnpro>	kushal, using ctrl+]
Jul 05 20:07:00 <rtnpro>	kushal, I see that the ffile pyrfid.c consists of only 128 lines
Jul 05 20:07:11 <kushal>	rtnpro, it depends, in this example , only two files
Jul 05 20:07:34 <rtnpro>	kushal, but using ctrl+] we go to the 200th line
Jul 05 20:07:42 <rtnpro>	kushal, how?
Jul 05 20:07:43 <kushal>	rtnpro, it also shows the filename ?
