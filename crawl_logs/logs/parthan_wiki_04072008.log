Jul 04 22:43:52 <techno_freak>	hmm, and..
Jul 04 22:43:52 <khushi_>	it allows users to freely create and edit Web pages using any Web browser. ...

Jul 04 22:44:36 <ecntrk_>	thus making a database so huge..
Jul 04 22:44:52 <techno_freak>	<END>
Jul 04 22:45:24 <bose_aritra>	its easy to get any information, so its successful.
Jul 04 22:45:38 <techno_freak>	What makes Wikipedia so awesome is, the entire content is not written by few people and hence doesnt represent one Point-of-View.
Jul 04 22:45:56 <techno_freak>	It's all there by means of contribution from people all over the world
Jul 04 22:46:09 <susenj>	!
Jul 04 22:46:41 <techno_freak>	It was possible to amass such a great amount of information within a single site because people were allowed to freely contribute

Jul 04 22:55:55 <techno_freak>	Wiki are an important tool for Collaborative Development
Jul 04 22:56:17 <Atanu_bera>	sorryfor late, Attendance Atanu Bera
Jul 04 22:56:23 <techno_freak>	Why? Because it enables people to freely add textual content, and others to freely edit them as well

Jul 04 22:56:33 *	Soumya___ is now known as Soumya
Jul 04 22:57:11 <techno_freak>	For example, if you are writing a essay about dgplug, kushal can just start a page and put some initial points, while all of you can participate adding more contents into it
Jul 04 22:57:48 <techno_freak>	kushal can occasionally peep in, review the contents, edit them, format them, and make the page transform into an awesome easy on dgplug

Jul 04 22:58:47 <techno_freak>	bose_aritra, yes
Jul 04 22:58:55 <bose_aritra>	is it so that only khushal can edit.
Jul 04 22:59:10 <bose_aritra>	that means editing option is not for all.
Jul 04 22:59:13 <kushal>	bose_aritra, who is he ?
Jul 04 22:59:17 <techno_freak>	bose_aritra, no, the very basic idea of wiki is that any one can add, edit or delete content
Jul 04 22:59:43 <bose_aritra>	but what i want to edit may be right
Jul 04 22:59:57 <bose_aritra>	who is governing the whole process?
Jul 04 23:00:15 <techno_freak>	bose_aritra, any one as in [1] any one accessing the site [2] any one who is a registered member of the wiki site [3] any one who has been granted edit privileges by the admin or the page creator
Jul 04 23:00:45 <bose_aritra>	some can even play pranks.
Jul 04 23:00:45 <techno_freak>	it can [1] [2] or [3] because, depending upon how critical the content is, the owners of the wiki may choose it to be moderated wiki
Jul 04 23:00:53 <techno_freak>	<eof>
Jul 04 23:01:01 <bose_aritra>	ok
Jul 04 23:01:02 *	Soumya_ has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
Jul 04 23:01:13 <techno_freak>	So, from the above example, we can clearly see what Wikis are for.
Jul 04 23:01:39 <techno_freak>	The entire content blooms up not because of one persons contribution, but many people contributing their bits and bytes
Jul 04 23:01:58 <techno_freak>	A lot of documents you see in various project's sites are indeed created by this method
Jul 04 23:02:33 <techno_freak>	Now, the interesting question arises
Jul 04 23:02:55 <techno_freak>	If anyone can edit, even let it be registered users, how do you ensure that the content is trustable?
Jul 04 23:03:13 <techno_freak>	Wiki proved it can indeed do. But how?
Jul 04 23:03:37 <techno_freak>	It follows the concept "More the number of eyes looking at, the better and dependable the content becomes"
Jul 04 23:03:57 <techno_freak>	Let's take an ideal example to understand this concept
Jul 04 23:04:31 <techno_freak>	[A] goes to Wikipedia and creates a page on Kolkatta
Jul 04 23:04:57 <techno_freak>	he adds some initial content and leaves the page open for any one to add or edit it
Jul 04 23:05:38 <techno_freak>	now [B] comes and sees the page. He has some interesting information about Kol and hence he adds them to the page.
Jul 04 23:05:56 *	Soumya___ (n=chatzill@117.192.7.195) has joined #dgplug
Jul 04 23:06:13 <techno_freak>	[A] comes back to the page, finds [B]'s contents which is good, but has some spellos here and there.
Jul 04 23:06:22 <techno_freak>	so [A] fixes those spellos and saves the page.
Jul 04 23:07:07 <techno_freak>	after this has happened [X] sees the page. But [X] is an evil chap, so he adds spam links all over the page, replacing the original contents by [A] and [B]
Jul 04 23:07:35 <techno_freak>	now [A] and [B] come to know that their page has been spoiled by someone
Jul 04 23:07:41 <techno_freak>	So, what's the solution?
Jul 04 23:08:32 <techno_freak>	[1] Most wikis offer version control of the pages. So, you can always go to last edits, see the content, either revert to that old version or just copy the content and paste it into the existing page, save it
Jul 04 23:09:08 <techno_freak>	[2] A and B have their own personal copies of the content. So A again adds the initial content, asks B to add his and brings back the page again
Jul 04 23:09:30 <techno_freak>	Now, you might ask can't X return back and do the vandalism again?
Jul 04 23:09:43 <techno_freak>	Yes, in fact he can if A still decides to keep the page open to anyone
Jul 04 23:09:58 *	Soumya__ has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
Jul 04 23:10:39 <techno_freak>	Or else, A might give editing permissions to B and state in the his page that anybody with related information can mail him, sending their content which if found appropriate will be added to the wiki page

Jul 04 23:10:45 *	Soumya____ (n=chatzill@117.192.2.3) has joined #dgplug
Jul 04 23:11:13 <techno_freak>	Most wikis go for the second mode where they ask users to register themselves, to prevent spam bots from acting upon
Jul 04 23:11:42 <techno_freak>	Wikipedia has been following an open access policy in its initial days
Jul 04 23:11:57 <techno_freak>	which proved futile as the spammers and objectionable content started to increase
Jul 04 23:12:50 <techno_freak>	in its initial days, it worked because 1000s of people thronged to wikipedia, and hence when an objectionable content was found there were people to remove it and bring the page back to its previous state
Jul 04 23:13:06 <techno_freak>	now, wikipedia follows registration process, if am not wrong
Jul 04 23:13:17 <techno_freak>	Any questions so far?
Jul 04 23:14:50 *	rtnpro (n=rtnpro@117.99.1.142) has joined #dgplug
Jul 04 23:15:14 <rtnpro>	kushal, sorry ...I was disconnected

Jul 04 23:16:18 <rtnpro>	kushal, ok... sorry for that
Jul 04 23:16:25 <techno_freak>	So, what are the well known Wiki softwares?
Jul 04 23:16:37 <techno_freak>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_software names some
Jul 04 23:16:38 <bose_aritra>	wikimapia
Jul 04 23:17:15 <ecntrk1>	wikiwikiweb...!
Jul 04 23:17:20 <techno_freak>	The most widely used as MediaWiki, MoinMoin and Trac
Jul 04 23:17:35 <techno_freak>	[Q5] Do you know what dgplug uses?

Jul 04 23:20:12 <ecntrk1>	it's in there...
Jul 04 23:20:16 <ecntrk1>	<eof>
Jul 04 23:20:54 <techno_freak>	ya, righto. so you have all landed up there isn't it?
Jul 04 23:21:11 <ecntrk1>	:-D
Jul 04 23:21:14 <bose_aritra>	:)
Jul 04 23:21:16 <techno_freak>	Editing a wiki page is simple, starting one too is..
Jul 04 23:21:53 <techno_freak>	But wikis follow a syntax for marking text in different formats such as lists, tables, headings, etc.
Jul 04 23:22:32 <techno_freak>	Though this might be different between various wiki softwares, it is fairly straightforward
Jul 04 23:22:54 <techno_freak>	It's more fun to explore this markup syntax than being thought..
Jul 04 23:23:11 <techno_freak>	So, we are going to do an exercise over this weekend with wiki
Jul 04 23:23:20 <techno_freak>	this will help us understand how to work with a wiki page
Jul 04 23:23:49 <techno_freak>	[Q6] Hope you all are registered with wiki.dgplug.org? If not, do it right away.
