Jun 28 17:12:18 <kushal>	anyone did ?

Jun 28 17:12:47 <koustava_>	kushal,I have read
Jun 28 17:12:53 <kushal>	any question 
Jun 28 17:13:28 <praveenkumar>	kushal, me too these are basics and all doubts already cleared in logs itself
Jun 28 17:13:29 <koustava_>	kushal,in root there nothing is appearing after ls -
Jun 28 17:13:48 <kushal>	you people are supposed to type ! and wait before talking
Jun 28 17:14:16 <kushal>	koustava_, can not understand , please say it again
Jun 28 17:14:41 <praveenkumar>	koustava_, their is no option for 'ls -' i think its 'cd -' .
Jun 28 17:15:13 <koustava_>	kushal,when I having cd /root
Jun 28 17:15:27 <koustava_>	kushal,then trying to have ls -
Jun 28 17:15:39 <koustava_>	kushal,nothing is showing
Jun 28 17:15:44 <kushal>	koustava_,  first of all you can not do cd /root unless you are root
Jun 28 17:16:02 <kushal>	also the command is cd - to back to the previous directory 
Jun 28 17:16:05 <kushal>	not ls -
Jun 28 17:16:08 <koustava_>	kushal,I am in root
Jun 28 17:16:22 <kushal>	koustava_, you are using root account ?
Jun 28 17:16:28 <koustava_>	kushal,yes
Jun 28 17:16:32 <kushal>	I mean you are logged in as root ?
Jun 28 17:16:37 <kushal>	koustava_, that is very bad
Jun 28 17:16:53 <kushal>	create a simple user account 
Jun 28 17:16:55 <kushal>	and use that 
Jun 28 17:17:12 <kushal>	you are not supposed to use root account for the normal usage
Jun 28 17:17:19 <kushal>	s/normal/regular
Jun 28 17:17:25 <koustava_>	kushal,no I was writing the command only in root
Jun 28 17:17:46 <kushal>	what do you mean by "writing the command only in root"
Jun 28 17:17:48 <kushal>	?
Jun 28 17:17:55 <koustava_>	kushal,I always use normal account
Jun 28 17:18:23 <koustava_>	kushal,when I was working in /tmp
Jun 28 17:18:35 <koustava_>	kushalm,then coming to root
Jun 28 17:18:44 <kushal>	 /root ?
Jun 28 17:18:50 <koustava_>	kushal,some problem is there
Jun 28 17:19:01 <kushal>	you can not access that folder unless you are the root user 
Jun 28 17:19:21 <kushal>	from your regular user account you can not read /root
Jun 28 17:19:21 <koustava_>	kushal,I am now a root user
Jun 28 17:19:31 <kushal>	koustava_, how you become a root user ?
Jun 28 17:19:45 <praveenkumar>	koustava_, i think after open the terminal he become superuser and then execute commands .
Jun 28 17:20:00 <praveenkumar>	kushal, ^^
Jun 28 17:20:01 <koustava_>	kushal,su -
Jun 28 17:20:08 <koustava_>	kushal,password
Jun 28 17:20:10 <kushal>	koustava_, then you are already in /root
Jun 28 17:20:30 <koustava_>	kushal,yes that is I am talking
Jun 28 17:20:41 <kushal>	then what is the problem ?
Jun 28 17:20:50 <koustava_>	[root@koustava ~]# cd /root
Jun 28 17:20:51 <koustava_>	[root@koustava ~]# ls /root
Jun 28 17:20:53 <koustava_>	anaconda-ks.cfg  fedora.repo  install.log  install.log.syslog
Jun 28 17:20:54 <koustava_>	[root@koustava ~]#
